\chapter{Propagating the Uncertainty from Stereo Images to the Cost Volume}\label{chap:propagating}
In the previous chapter, different methods for joining credal sets using a copula have been presented. In this chapter, we present a first methodological attempt to apply these results to an uncertainty propagation problem in a stereo matching context. Usage of imprecise models for various engineering problems different from stereo matching have been investigated in related work \cite{oberkampf_mathematical_2001,beer_imprecise_2013,patelli_integrated_2014}. We here specifically use possibility distributions from \Cref{chap:representation_of_uncertainty} as uncertainty models on the intensity values of epipolar images used in stereo matching. We will then propagate the uncertainty from those images to the cost volume using results from \Cref{sec:necessity_functions}. We will also show that propagating the uncertainty has the potential to improve the disparity map derived from the cost volume. This chapter takes up work and data already published in \cite{malinowski_copulas_2022, malinowski_uncertainty_2023}.

It is important to note that in this disparity estimation problem, we only take into account the uncertainty in our input image intensities, without considering the uncertainty of the cost function's ability to correctly identify the true disparity as its minimum. In other words, we do not consider the uncertainty arising from the difference between ``two patches are very similar'' and ``the pixels at the center of the patches are homologous''. We refer to \Cref{fig:adherence_window} and more broadly to the different discussions in \Cref{sec:stereo_matching} for more details. This chapter focuses on the propagation of uncertainty. We will thus consider a stereo matching pipeline with a simple cost function and no \acrshort{sgm} regularization. Indeed, propagating the uncertainty through a cost volume optimization is too complex and computationally expensive to be solved with this chapter's method, even though it is an interesting problem to consider. We will consider the different problem of uncertainty modeling with \acrshort{sgm} regularization in \Cref{chap:epistemic_uncertainty}.

\begin{remark}
    It is interesting to see that in \cite{quinio_random_1991,quinio_random_1992}, the author considered using closed random sets (a concept related to \acrfull{ip} and belief functions studied in \Cref{chap:representation_of_uncertainty}) to model the uncertainty of a stereoscopic setup. They mainly consider the uncertainty arising from the limited resolution of digital images (as we do in this chapter), and from the precision of the calibration setup: focal length of cameras, baseline distance, orientation, and vergence angle of the cameras \etc. They consider that the uncertainty from dense matching is not of epistemic nature, but of aleatoric nature, and thus do not model it by imprecise models as we do in \Cref{chap:epistemic_uncertainty}. This hypothesis is justified because they achieve the stereo matching step using a window based \acrshort{zncc} cost function (without \acrshort{sgm}, as it was not published at the time), which, by nature, possesses strong links with probabilistic models.
\end{remark}

\section{Context and Hypotheses for Uncertainty Propagation }\label{sec:sources_of_uncertainty}
\subsection{Considered Stereo Matching Pipeline}
We consider the \acrfull{sad} as our cost function, introduced in \Cref{sec:cost_volume_computation}, and reminded here. Given patches $W_L\subset I_L$ and $W_R\subset I_R$ of the same shape with $n$ pixels (usually squares):
\begin{align}
    \SAD(W_L, W_R) = \sum_{(p_i, q_i)\in (W_L, W_R)}|I_L(p_i) - I_R(q_i)|\label{eq:SAD}
\end{align}
where $p_i$ and $q_i$ are pixels at the same position $i$ in their patch. For convenience purposes, we will refer to the Absolute Difference between two pixels as AD (when there is no sum involved). An illustration of windows from stereo images to compare is displayed in \Cref{fig:Cones}, and an illustration of the AD between pixels and \acrshort{sad} cost function can be found in \Cref{fig:SAD}. The simplicity of the formulation of the \acrshort{sad} cost function allows for a more didactic presentation of the uncertainty propagation problem. For the same reason, we do not consider the \acrshort{sgm} regularization here. The modeling of uncertainty for more advanced cost functions and \acrshort{sgm} methods will be considered in \Cref{chap:epistemic_uncertainty}.

  \caption{Homologous pixels in a pair of images. From \cite{malinowski_uncertainty_2024}}\label{fig:Cones}
\end{figure}

\begin{remark}
    Although the \acrshort{sad} is not the best performing cost function for dense matching, it is both fast and easily parallelizable. It is often used for comparison in cost-based stereo algorithms \cite{hirschmuller_evaluation_2007, zbontar_stereo_2016}, or in other applications. The limitations of the \acrshort{sad} cost function are well-known, \ie mostly a lack of robustness to gain and offset between patches. In the case of Middlebury images, illumination conditions and calibration of cameras are controlled, which are conditions well-suited for the \acrshort{sad} cost function.
    Considering a simple cost function such as \acrshort{sad} is relevant for different reasons:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simple stereo matching algorithms are often used as a quick and easy method for estimating the disparity.
        \item Simple cost functions (such as \acrshort{sad}, \acrshort{zncc}, \etc) considered here are still used in other problems, such as video compression, for instance \cite{richardson_h264_2006}.
    \end{itemize}

    \label{fig:SAD}
\end{figure}

In our experiments, we considered the ``Cones'' images from the 2003 Middlebury stereo dataset (\url{https://vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/scenes2003/}), as displayed in \Cref{fig:color_cones_image}. The two images have a of size $375 \times 450$, and the range of considered disparities is $[-60, 0]$.

\subsection{Uncertainty Model for Epipolar Images Intensities}\label{sec:uncertainty_models_for_epi_image}
To maintain simplicity in this section, we will not consider panchromatic images, such as Pl√©iades products, encoding the reflectance values as positive integer, usually contained in $[0, 5000]$. Instead, we consider grayscale images that have intensity levels quantified within the range $[0, 255]$, which will represent our measurable space $\X$.

\begin{remark}
    This hypothesis is not constraining, as we can easily normalize reflectances in order to encode them using 8-bit integers value, although doing so reduces the precision of the initial images. Moreover, this normalization step is often required to fit a given format, for instance if the images must be processed by a CNN trained on 8-bit integers.
\end{remark}

We postulate that a pixel's intensity value can deviate around its observed value with a range of $\pm i_\sigma$, with the observed value being the most likely. This specific hypothesis remains simple and relatively plausible with regard to the processing leading to the epipolar images. We then assume that the uncertainty from the noise of the sensor capturing the image, from pre-processing steps such radiometric and geometric correction, or epipolar resampling (see \Cref{sec:uncertainty_cars}) or from the quantification of observed radiometric values into 8-bit integers, are not exactly known, but can be model by a possibility distribution introduced in \Cref{sec:possibilities}. Consequently, we model the uncertainty of each pixel $p\in I_L,I_R$ intensity with a possibility distribution $\pi$, centered around the observed intensity $i_p\in[0,255]$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pixel_possibility}
    \pi(i_p)=1,\quad \pi(i_p\pm i_\sigma)=\alpha\,,
\end{equation}
with $\alpha \in [0,1]$. To remain simple, we chose $i_\sigma=1$ in the following, which is relatively narrow but allows simplification without impacting our reasoning. Similarly, we do not consider multiple $\alpha$ values in order to limit the number of focal sets considered.

    \label{fig:possibility_pixel_intensity}
\end{figure}
Choosing thus simple possibility distribution is convenient, but results obtained in this chapter can easily be extended to more complex possibility distributions. In our simulation, $\alpha = 0.3$ for pixels in the left image and $\alpha = 0.4$ for pixels in the right image. We use different values of $\alpha$ for the left and right images because the uncertainty model may vary between images due to differences in exposure, noise levels, or camera calibration. The values on themselves are chosen arbitrarily for the purpose of this example. From the credal set point of view of \Cref{def:credal_set}, this model effectively states that we accept any probability distribution supported within $[i_p - 1, i_p + 1]$ where the probability measure $P$ satisfies $\{P(A) \leq \sup_{i \in A} \pi(i)\}$ as an acceptable model for our uncertainty, as in \Cref{def:possibility_credal_set}. The mass distribution function $m_p$ from \Cref{def:mass_distribution_function} associated with this credal set possesses two focal sets $a^p$ (\Cref{def:focal_set}):
\begin{eqnarray}
    &m_p(a^p_1=\opi i_p, i_p\cli)=1-\alpha\,\nonumber\\
    &m_p(a^p_2=\opi i_p-1, i_p + 1\cli)=\alpha\,\label{eq:pixel_mass}
\end{eqnarray}
with $\opi\cdot, \cdot\cli$ referring to integer intervals. In particular, $\opi i_p, i_p\cli$ corresponds to the singleton $\{i_p\}$.

\begin{remark}
    The hypothesis of modeling the uncertainty on image intensities by possibility distributions does not consider uncertainty from potentially bigger sources of errors, such as satellite vibrations during the acquisition, or errors in the computations of epipolar lines. Those type of errors have been encountered on some Pl√©iades acquisitions, and lead to significant biases and errors on the final \acrshort{dsm}, that our simple model does not account for. We here suppose that the geometric models of each sensor as well as the epipolar geometry are perfectly known.  
\end{remark}

\subsection{Dependency Model between Epipolar Images}
We described the uncertainty models for pixels in both images, but we also need to define the dependency model between every pixel of both images. Indeed, as some pixels between images represent the light reflected by the same object, it seems natural that their (uncertain) values are correlated. In our case, we propose to model their dependency with the product copula if the pixels are not from the same physical object, meaning that the value of their intensities are independent. For pixels belonging to the same object, we model their dependency using a Gaussian copula with a covariance matrix $R$. Those copulas were introduced in \Cref{eq:gaussian_copula} from \Cref{chap:representation_of_uncertainty}. We remind here the formulation of a Gaussian $n$-copula $C_R$:
\begin{align}
    C_R(u_1 \enum u_n)=\Phi_R(\Phi^{-1}(u_1) \enum \Phi^{-1}(u_n))\label{eq:gaussian_copula}
\end{align} where $\Phi_R$ is the joint multivariate \acrfull{cdf} of a Gaussian variable with correlation matrix $R$, and $\Phi^{-1}$ is the inverse \acrshort{cdf} of a univariate Gaussian variable. Gaussian copulas are popular and simple copulas used to represent dependencies between more than $2$ variables. By comparison, the different $2$-copulas presented in \Cref{sec:copulas} cannot always be defined in more than $2$ dimensions or possess a quite complex formulation. Another method for modeling the dependency for more than $2$ variables is to express a $n$-copula as a combination of $2$-copulas, which is called a vine copula (\cite{czado_vine_2022}). However, this is a complex subject that is not adapted to our type of dependency, and is therefore not explored in this thesis.

In our experiments, the correlation values inside the covariance matrix are based on a segmentation $S:(I_L\cup I_R)\rightarrow\opi1,K\cli$, $K\in\mathbb{N}$, of the images. This segmentation is the result of a \textit{k-means} clustering performed on the ground truth disparity map. An example of such a clustering is presented in \Cref{fig:clustering_example}, with $K=8$. In real life scenarios, the correlation matrix must be estimated by other means, as the ground truth disparity is not available. We can for instance use a semantic segmentation algorithm \cite{hariharan_hypercolumns_2014,ronneberger_u-net_2015}, or use other statistical estimators \cite{touloumis_nonparametric_2015}. We suppose here that the correlation between pixels' intensities is well-known, as we also supposed we know the type of copula modeling their dependency. Given the segmentation $S$ and two pixels $(p, q)\in(I_L\cup I_R)^2$, their covariance is here determined by:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:correlation}
    \sigma(p, q) =
    \begin{cases}
        1 &\text{ if }p=q,\\
        \rho_k, &\text{ if } p\ne q\text{ and }S(p)=S(q)\,, \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}\,.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $0<\rho_k<1$ is the correlation of pixels belonging to segment $k\in\opi 1, N\cli$. During our simulations, the segmentation contains $K=8$ different clusters. For every $k$ in $\opi1,K\cli$, $\rho_k$ is assigned a value between $0.9$ and $1$ in order to really emphasize their correlation. Given a set of pixels $\{p_1 \enum p_n\}\subseteq(I_L\cup I_R)^2$, their covariance matrix $R$ is therefore:
\begin{align}\label{eq:correlation_matrix}
    R = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & \sigma(p_{1}, p_{2}) & \ldots & \sigma(p_{1}, p_{n-1}) & \sigma(p_{1}, p_{n})\\
        \sigma(p_{2}, p_{1}) & 1 & \ldots & \sigma(p_{2}, p_{n-1}) & \sigma(p_{2}, p_{n})\\
        \ldots & \ldots & \ldots & \ldots & \ldots\\
        \sigma(p_{n-1}, p_{1}) & \sigma(p_{n-1}, p_{2}) & \ldots & 1 & \sigma(p_{n-1}, p_{n})\\
        \sigma(p_{n}, p_{1}) & \sigma(p_{n}, p_{2}) & \ldots & \sigma(p_{n}, p_{n-1}) & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}

In practice, we will only compute the correlation matrix between the two windows from the reference and secondary images that are compared. Both windows have a $3\times 3$ shape, we thus consider Gaussian $18-$copulas to model the dependency between pixels. This copula will be used for joining marginal masses in the uncertainty propagation step, as in \Cref{def:joint_mass,def:cumulative_masses_credal_set} to compute the credal set $\M_{mass}$. It will also be used in \Cref{sec:montecarlo} to draw Monte Carlo samples, in order to estimate the credal set $\M_{robust}$ from \Cref{def:robust_credal_set}.

\end{figure}

\begin{remark}
    The segmentation is based on the ground truth disparity map. This means that two objects with similar disparities located at opposite sides of the image will be considered as belonging to the same object and thus correlated. In practice, those pixels are never compared, as we only measure the dissimilarity between small windows in a restricted disparity range. The clustering is thus only used at a \textit{local} scale. 
    
    Secondly, the segmentation allows computing the Gaussian copula, which will be used to propagate the uncertainty models. We will validate the uncertainty propagation in \Cref{sec:montecarlo} with Monte Carlo samples using the same copula. As long as the copulas used are the same between the propagation and validation, it does not really matter which correlation matrix is used. We still tried to create a realistic but simple dependency model for the sake of the example, but it is not required from a theoretical point of view.
\end{remark}

\section{Propagating the Uncertainty with Belief Functions and a Copula}
Having defined both marginal models for pixel intensities using possibility distributions and dependency models using copulas, we can now join them all to construct a multivariate uncertainty model, as seen in \Cref{sec:methods_for_joining_credal_sets}. We will see in this section how the multivariate models can then be used to compute the uncertainty regarding the cost curve. 

\subsection{From Multivariate Uncertainty Models to the Propagated Model}
We first detail how multivariate models are used to propagate uncertainty in the precise case. We will then do the same in the imprecise setting by analogy.

Consider a mapping $f:\X_1\times\X_2\rightarrow\mathcal{Z}$ from a product space $\X_1\times\X_2$ to a space $\mathcal{Z}$, which propagates multiple random variables $X_1$, $X_2$ to a new random variable $Z=f(X_1, ~X_2)$. In our case, $f$ will be the \acrshort{sad} cost function propagating the intensities to the matching cost. When considering precise probabilities, the probability of $Z$ on atoms $z$ is obtained by summing the probabilities of all events $X_1=x_1$, $X_2=x_2$ whose image by $f$ is $z$: 
\begin{align}\label{eq:precise_propagate_proba}
    \forall z\in\mathcal{Z}, P_Z(z)=\sum_{\substack{x_1,x_2\\z=f(x_1,x_2)}}P(x_1,x_2).
\end{align}
where $P(x_1,x_2)$ is the joint probability, which is linked to its marginals by a copula $C$. $P_Z$ is completely determined by evaluating every combination of atoms of $\X_1$ and $\X_2$.

\begin{example}\label{ex:propagated_probability}
    Consider the same setting as \Cref{ex:copulas}, where a dealer throws two coins in a separate room. The coins seem fair when looked at independently. In this example, a coin landing on heads rewards you with $1$‚Ç¨ (or any currency of your choice), and a coin landing on tails rewards you with $0$‚Ç¨. So you earn $2$‚Ç¨ if both coins land on heads, $1$‚Ç¨ if only one coin land on heads, and $0$‚Ç¨ if both coins land on tails. We are interested in the uncertainty regarding your earnings, noted $Z$.
    
    In \Cref{ex:copulas}, we consider $3$ different cases, each leading to a different copula $C$ modeling the dependency between the probability $P_1$ of the first coin and $P_2$ of the second coin. For each copula, we then computed the joint probability $P$.
    
    In the first case, where coin throws were independent, we saw that the joint probability $P$ was:\\
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        & P(\text{heads}, ~\text{heads}) = 0.25\\
        & P(\text{heads}, ~\text{tails}) = 0.25
    \end{align*}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        & P(\text{tails}, ~\text{tails}) = 0.25 \\
        & P(\text{tails}, ~\text{heads}) = 0.25
    \end{align*}
    \end{minipage}
    In that case, it holds that the probability $P_Z$ of our earnings is:
    \begin{align*}
        & P_Z(Z=2) = P(\text{heads}, ~\text{heads}) = 0.25\\
        & P_Z(Z=1) = P(\text{heads}, ~\text{tails}) + P(\text{tails}, ~\text{heads}) = 0.5 \\
        & P_Z(Z=0) = P(\text{tails}, ~\text{tails}) = 0.25
    \end{align*}
    
    In the second case, where coin throws were rigged to land on the same side, we saw that the joint probability $P$ was:\\
    \noindent
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        & P(\text{heads}, ~\text{heads}) = 0.5\\
        & P(\text{heads}, ~\text{tails}) = 0
    \end{align*}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        & P(\text{tails}, ~\text{tails}) = 0.5\\
        & P(\text{tails}, ~\text{heads}) = 0 
    \end{align*}
    \end{minipage}
    Following the same methodology, we have:\\
    \noindent\begin{minipage}[b]{0.33\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        & P_Z(Z=2) = 0.5
    \end{align*}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.33\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        & P_Z(Z=1) = 0
    \end{align*}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.33\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        & P_Z(Z=0) = 0.5
    \end{align*}
    \end{minipage}
    
    In the third case, where coin throws were rigged to land on opposite sides, we saw that the joint probability $P$ was:\\
    \noindent\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        & P(\text{heads}, ~\text{heads}) = 0\\
        & P(\text{heads}, ~\text{tails}) = 0.5
    \end{align*}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        & P(\text{tails}, ~\text{tails}) = 0\\
        & P(\text{tails}, ~\text{heads}) = 0.5
    \end{align*}
    \end{minipage}
    Therefore:\\
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.33\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        & P_Z(Z=2) = 0
    \end{align*}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.33\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        & P_Z(Z=1) = 1
    \end{align*}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}[b]{0.33\linewidth}
    \begin{align*}
        & P_Z(Z=0) = 0
    \end{align*}
    \end{minipage}
\end{example}

Determining every $(x_1, x_2)$, whose image by $f$ equals $z$, is not always trivial. This becomes even more complex when considering $n>2$ marginal variables. Similarly, the joint probability $P(x_1,x_2)$ is computed using a H-volume, which is the sum of $2^n$ terms, thus also increasing exponentially with the dimension.

There are multiple ways of extending \Cref{eq:precise_propagate_proba} to the imprecise setting, as there are multiple ways of aggregating imprecise models using a copula. We described in \Cref{chap:joining_credal_sets} three methods for joining marginal credal sets, creating three different multivariate credal sets $\M_{robust}$, $\M_{mass}$ and $\M_{agg}$.

The robust approach of extending \Cref{eq:precise_propagate_proba} is based on the robust approach from \Cref{sec:robust_method}. Given $n$ marginal credal sets $\M_i$, we can join them into a credal set $\M_{robust}$ using a copula $C$, as in \eqref{eq:robust_set}. The propagated uncertain model $\M^Z_{robust}$ is then defined as:
\begin{align}
    \M^Z_{robust} = \{P_Z~|~\forall z\in Z, ~P_Z(z)=\sum_{\substack{x_1 \enum x_n\\z=f(x_1 \enum x_n)}}P(x_1 \enum x_n), ~P\in\M_{robust}\}
\end{align}
Practically, this set is computed by sampling every probability $P_i$ from each marginal credal set $\M_i$ and joining them using \hyperref[theorem:sklar]{Sklar's Theorem} into a multivariate probability $P$. Then for each $z=P(x_1 \enum x_n)$, we can compute $P_Z$ from $P$ using \eqref{eq:precise_propagate_proba}. In a few words, each sample $(P_1 \enum P_n)$ leads to a new $P$, itself leading to a new $P_Z$. Sampling through every $(P_1 \enum P_n)$ thus leads to the estimation of the uncertain model of $Z$. This method is complicated to compute, but correctly propagates the uncertainty. In the case of the \acrshort{sad} cost function, the robust credal set is defined as:
\begin{align}
    \M^\SAD_{robust} = \{P_\SAD~|~\forall z\in \SAD, ~P_\SAD(z)=\sum_{\substack{p_1 \enum p_{18}\\z=\SAD(p_1 \enum p_{18})}}P(p_1 \enum p_{18}), ~P\in\M_{robust}\}
\end{align}

We saw that it was easier to compute $\M_{mass}$ than $\M_{robust}$. Thus, another way of approximating the uncertainty model of $Z$ is to compute it using $\M_{mass}$. This is done by replacing the probability on atoms from \Cref{eq:precise_propagate_proba} with the joint mass $m_C$ from \Cref{eq:joint_mass} \cite{gray_dependent_2021}. Consider $n$ uncertain variables $X_i$, each modeled by a mass distribution function whose $j$-th focal set is noted $a^i_j$. Given their multivariate mass $m_C$, it is possible to compute the mass distribution function $m_Z$ of a random set $Z=f(X_1 \enum X_n)$ as:
\begin{align}
    \forall a^Z\subseteq\mathcal{Z}, m_Z(a^Z) = \sum_{\substack{a^1_i \enum a^n_j\\a^Z=f(a^1_i \enum  a^n_j)}}m_C(a^1_i \enum a^n_j)\label{eq:mass_propagated}
\end{align}
leading to a credal set $\M_{mass}^Z$:
\begin{align}
    \M_{mass}^Z &= \{~P_Z~|~\forall A\subseteq\mathcal{Z},~P_Z(A)\geqslant \sum_{a^Z\subseteq A}m_Z(a^Z)\}\\
    &=\{~P_Z~|~\forall A\subseteq\mathcal{Z},~P_Z(A)\geqslant \sum_{\substack{a^1\enum a^n \\ f(a_1\enum a_n)\subseteq A}}m_C(a^1\enum a^n)~\}
\end{align}

In order to compute the propagated mass $m_Z$ (and its associated belief function) from \Cref{eq:mass_propagated}, two difficulties arise. The first one is to determine what the focal sets $a_Z$ of $m_Z$ will be, which corresponds to the subscript $a^Z=f(a^n_1 \enum  a^n_j)$ of the previous sum. Computing the image of $f$ for every combination of focal sets $(a^1_i \enum a^n_j)$ is even more difficult than in the precise case, as we are computing images of sets instead of real numbers. The second difficulty is to compute the joint mass $m_C$, as in the case of the \acrshort{sad} it requires computing the H-volume of a $18$-copula. Those difficulties will be addressed in \Cref{sec:propagated_focal_sets,sec:propagated_masses}

We saw in \Cref{chap:joining_credal_sets} that in the situation where marginals are possibility distributions, $\M_{mass}$ and $\M_{agg}$ have the same bounds on Cartesian products of events (see \Cref{eq:inclusion_necessity}). We will thus only compute the lower bounds $Bel_C$ of $\M_{mass}$ as it also provides the bounds of $\M_{agg}$ on those events.

\subsection{Determining the Bounds of the Propagated Focal Sets}\label{sec:propagated_focal_sets}
In this section, we will detail how we compute the bounds of the \acrshort{sad} from marginal focal sets. Computing the image of sets should be approached with caution in the general case. However in our case, because we chose marginal focal sets with a simple expression, and because we are using a relatively regular cost function, computing the image is significantly easier.

Given a pixel $p$, we consider the mass distribution $m_p$ of \Cref{eq:pixel_mass} and its two focal sets $a_1^p$ and $a_2^p$ from \Cref{eq:pixel_mass}. For every pair of pixels $p\in I_L, q\in I_R$, we note $\AD_{pq}=|i_p - i_q|$, where $i$ refers to a pixel's intensity. Given $m_p$, there exist $3$ focal sets related to the absolute difference:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $a^{\AD}_1$ is the image of the AD of $a^p_1$ and $a^q_1$
    \item $a^{\AD}_2$ is the image of the AD of $a^p_2$ and $a^q_1$ or $a^p_1$ and $a^q_2$
    \item  $a^{\AD}_3$ is the image of the AD of $a^p_2$ and $a^q_2$
\end{itemize}
The non-monotonicity of the absolute value around $0$ needs to be taken into account to compute their exact image through the AD. Indeed, if a value $x$ is in $[-1,1]$, then its absolute value will be in $[0,1]$. Applying this remark to the AD yields the following focal sets:
\begin{align*}
    a^{\AD}_1&=\opi\AD_{pq},~\AD_{pq}\cli\,,\\
    a^{\AD}_2&=\opi\max(0, \AD_{pq} - 1),~\AD_{pq} + 1\cli\,,\\
    a^{\AD}_3&=\opi\max(0, \AD_{pq} - 2),~\AD_{pq} + 2\cli\,,
\end{align*}
\Cref{ex:ad_numerical_example} provides numerical examples of the value of $\AD$ focal sets.
\begin{example}\label{ex:ad_numerical_example}
    Let us compute the focal sets of the absolute difference between two pixels. Let $p$ and $q$ be pixels of the left and right image, respectively.
    
    $\bullet$ First, suppose that $i_p=100$ and $i_q=150$. Focal sets of $i_p$ and $i_q$ are then:\newline\medskip
    \begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
    	\begin{align*}
    		a^p_1&=\opi i_p,~i_p\cli= \{100\}\\
    		a^p_2&=\opi i_p-1,~i_p+1\cli\\
    		&= \{99, 100, 101\}
    	\end{align*}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
    	\begin{align*}
    		a^q_1&=\opi i_q,~i_q\cli= \{150\}\\
    		a^q_2&=\opi i_q-1,~i_q+1\cli\\
    		&= \{149, 150, 151\}
    	\end{align*}
    \end{minipage}\bigskip\newline
    Focal sets of the absolute difference between $p$ and $q$ will therefore be:
    \begin{align*}
        a^\AD_1&=\{|a^p_1-a^q_1|\}=\{50\}\\
        a^\AD_2&=\{|a^p_2-a^q_1|\}=\{|a^p_1-a^q_2|\}=\opi49, ~51\cli\\
        &=\opi50-1, ~50+1\cli\\
        a^\AD_3&=\{|a^p_2-a^q_2|\}=\opi48,~52\cli\\
        &= \opi50-2, ~50+2\cli
    \end{align*}
    
    $\bullet$ Suppose now that $i_p=100$ and $i_q=100$. Focal sets of $i_p$ and $i_q$ are then the same:
    	\begin{align*}
    		a^p_1=a^q_1&=\opi i_p,~i_p\cli= \{100\}\\
    		a^p_2=a^q_2&=\opi i_p-1,~i_p+1\cli\\
    		&= \{99, 100, 101\}
    	\end{align*}
    Focal sets of the absolute difference between $p$ and $q$ will therefore be:
    \begin{align*}
        &a^\AD_1=\{|a^p_1-a^q_1|\}=\{0\}\\
        &a^\AD_2=\{|a^p_2-a^q_1|\}=\{|a^p_1-a^q_2|\}=\opi0, ~1\cli\\
        &a^\AD_3=\{|a^p_2-a^q_2|\}=\opi0,~2\cli
    \end{align*}
\end{example}

Focal sets of the final \acrshort{sad} are then computed by simply summing the bounds of focal sets of the 9 $\AD$ (as in \Cref{fig:SAD}), for every combination $(a^{\AD_1}_{k_1}\enum a^{\AD_9}_{k_9})_{k_i\in\opi1,3\cli}$ of those focal sets:
\begin{align}
    a^\SAD=\sum_{i=1}^9a^{\AD_i}_{k_i}
\end{align}

In many cases, different combinations of $\AD$ focal sets will lead to the same \acrshort{sad} focal set. Actually, if every $\AD$ is greater than $2$ so that each $a^\AD_i$ is symmetric with regard to its $\AD$, as in the first bullet point of \Cref{ex:ad_numerical_example}, there will only be $19$ focal sets $a^\SAD$ for the \acrshort{sad}. They are of the following form:
\begin{align}\label{eq:nested_SAD}
    a^\SAD = \opi\SAD-t,\SAD+t\cli,\text{ with }t\in\opi0, ~18\cli
\end{align}
In comparison, there are $3^9=19\,683$ different combinations of $\AD$ focal sets.

When every $\AD$ is greater than $2$, it holds that:
\begin{align*}
    a^\SAD = \opi\SAD-t,\SAD+t\cli,\text{ with }t\in\opi0, ~18\cli
\end{align*}
This can easily be seen by considering $\AD$ that are similar to the first point of \Cref{ex:ad_numerical_example}. This equation translates the fact that focal sets of the \acrshort{sad} form a nested family of sets, \ie there is an inclusion relationship linking them all. This also means that $\Bel_\SAD$ is actually a necessity function introduced in \Cref{def:possibility_credal_set}. We can thus compute a possibility distribution $\pi_\SAD$ to represent the uncertainty of the \acrshort{sad}. This can be useful to graphically represent the uncertainty of the \acrshort{sad}, if we later need to build joint uncertainty models using the \acrshort{sad}, or if we want to propagate the \acrshort{sad} uncertainty even further.

We proved in \cite{malinowski_uncertainty_2024} that in order to propagate marginal possibility distributions $\pi_i$ into a possibility distribution $\pi_Z$ using a copula and a propagating function $f$, a sufficient condition is that $f$ and $\pi_i$ verify:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $f$ is a monotone function applied to a linear combination $\alpha_1X_1+\ldots+\alpha_nX_n+\beta$ of marginal variables $X_i$
    \item Each $\pi_i$ is symmetrical and uni-modal (meaning that all values $x_i$ such that $\pi_i(x_i)=1$ are adjacent). For instance, all triangular possibility distributions verify this condition
\end{itemize}
\Cref{fig:unimodal_pi} displays an example of a uni-modal symmetrical possibility distribution.

\subsection{Computing the Mass of Propagated Focal Sets}\label{sec:propagated_masses}
%\section{Leveraging Specificities to Accelerate Computations}
Now that the bounds of the \acrshort{sad} have been computed, we need to compute the associated mass. Computing the joint mass over two $3 \times 3$ windows is significantly more complex. For each combination of marginal focal sets, the joint mass $m_C$ is computed using the H-volume of a $18$-copula, involving a sum of $2^{18}$ terms. Given that the uncertainty of each of the 18 pixels is represented by $2$ focal sets, we need to evaluate $2^{18}$ combinations of these marginal masses in total. This computation can thus become quite costly in memory and computation time, especially when computing it over a whole image.

In the case of the family of Gaussian copulas, their expression given by \Cref{eq:gaussian_copula} show that we need to compute the multivariate \acrshort{cdf}. A $18$-variate Gaussian \acrshort{cdf} does not possess a known analytic formula; it is thus computed by integrating its \acrfull{pdf} (so integrating a $18$-variate function), as expressed below:
\begin{align}\label{eq:gaussian_cdf}
    F(x_1 &\enum x_{18}) =\nonumber\\ &\int_{-\infty}^{x_1}\ldots\int_{-\infty}^{x_{18}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^{18}|R|}}\exp(-\frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}x_1 & \ldots & x_{18}\end{bmatrix}R^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}x_1 \\ \ldots \\ x_{18}\end{bmatrix})dx_1\ldots dx_{18}
\end{align}
Where $|R|$ is the determinant of $R$. Computing this \acrshort{cdf} can quickly become time-consuming ($40ms$ on average\footnote{With an AMD EPYC7713  64-Core Processor at 2GHz, using Python and the SciPy library}). For each pixel and each disparity, we need to compute the joint mass of $2^{18}$ focal sets in total, necessitating $2^{18}$ evaluations of its copula each time. Because there are around $170\,000$ pixels and $60$ disparities to be evaluated, the processing time is too large to be computed as such. We will instead see that we can leverage specificities of our problem to drastically reduce the computation time.
 
The first idea is to notice that if we can divide our variables into multiple mutually independent sets of variables, then the evaluation of the $18$-copula can be separated into the evaluation of multiple lower dimension copulas. To verify this statement, consider the following independent sets of variables $\{X_1 \enum X_k\}$ and $\{X_{k+1} \enum X_n\}$ with $k\in\opi1,n-1\cli$. Let $F_1 \enum  F_n$ be their marginals \acrshort{cdf}s. And let $F_{(1 \enum n)}$ be the joint \acrshort{cdf} of all variables, $F_{(1 \enum k)}$ the joint \acrshort{cdf} of the first set of variables and $F_{(k+1 \enum n)}$ the joint \acrshort{cdf} of the second set. The independence between the two sets means that for all $(x_1 \enum x_n)\in\X_1\tdt\X_n$ it holds that:
\begin{align*}
    F_{(1 \enum n)}(x_1 \enum x_n) = F_{(1 \enum k)}(x_1 \enum x_k)\cdot F_{(k+1 \enum n)}(x_{k+1} \enum x_n)
\end{align*}
Using Sklar's theorem, there exist a $n$-copula $C$, a $k$-copula $C'$ and a $n-k$-copula $C''$ respectively linking $F_{(1 \enum n)}$, $F_{(1 \enum k)}$, and $F_{(k+1 \enum n)}$ to their marginals:
\begin{align}
    C(F_1(x_1) \enum& F_n(x_n)) =\nonumber\\
    &C'(F_1(x_1) \enum F_k(x_k))\cdot C''(F_{k+1}(x_{k+1}) \enum F_n(x_n))\label{eq:copula_factorizing}
\end{align}

\begin{remark}
    We stated earlier that we did not consider vine copulas \cite{czado_vine_2022}, which are a way of constructing multivariate copulas by composition of bivariate (conditional) copulas. The decomposition $C$ into $C'$ and $C''$ actually follows the same idea of decomposing a copula into smaller copulas. Similarly, this decomposition also reminds the concept of hierarchical copulas \cite{joe_multivariate_1997}. So even though we are not using vine or hierarchical copulas, we use a similar philosophy in our computations.
\end{remark}

Establishing \Cref{eq:copula_factorizing} becomes interesting once we put it in relation with the following property:
\begin{proposition}[H-Volume factorizing]\label{prop:hvol_factorizing}
    Let $1<k<n$. If a $n$-copula $C$ can be expressed as the product of a $k$-copula $C'$ and a $(n-k)$-copula $C''$, then the H-volume of $C$ is the product of the H-volume $H'$ of $C'$ and the H-volume $H''$ of $C''$. This means that for all $(u_1 \enum u_n)\in[0,1]^n$ and for all $(v_1 \enum v_n)\in[0,1]^n$ such that $u_i\leqslant v_i$, it holds that:
    \begin{align}
        H_{u_1 \enum u_n}^{v_1 \enum v_n} = {H'}_{u_1 \enum u_k}^{v_1 \enum v_k}\cdot{H''}_{u_{k+1} \enum u_n}^{v_{k+1} \enum v_n}
    \end{align}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Let $1<k<n$, $C$ a $n$-copula, $C'$ a $k$-copula and $C''$ a $n-k$ copula. $H$, $H'$, $H''$ are the respective H-volume of $C$, $C'$, $C''$. Then:
    \begin{align*}
        %{H'}_{u_1 \enum  u_k}^{v_1 \enum  v_k}\times {H''}&_{u_{k+1} \enum  u_n}^{v_{k+1} \enum  v_n} = \left(\sum_{w_i\in\Pi_{i=1}^{k}\{u_i,v_i\}}(-1)^{|\{w_i~|~w_i=u_i\}|}C'(w_1 \enum w_k)\right)\\

            v_1 \enum  v_k\\
            u_1 \enum  u_k
        \end{matrix}
        \cdot {H''}&
        \begin{matrix}
            v_{k+1} \enum  v_n\\
            u_{k+1} \enum  u_n
        \end{matrix}= \left(\sum_{w_i\in\prod_{i=1}^{k}\{u_i,v_i\}}(-1)^{|\{w_i~|~w_i=u_i\}|}C'(w_1 \enum w_k)\right)\\
        &\times\left(\sum_{w_j\in\prod_{j=k+1}^{n}\{u_j,v_j\}}(-1)^{|\{w_j~|~w_j=u_j\}|}C''(w_{k+1} \enum w_n)\right)\\
        =& \sum_{w_i\in\prod_{i=1}^{k}\{u_i,v_i\}}\times\sum_{w_j\in\prod_{j=k+1}^{n}\{u_j,v_j\}}(-1)^{|\{w_i~|~w_i=u_i,~i\leqslant k\}|}\\
        &\times(-1)^{|\{w_j~|~w_j=u_j,~ j>k\}|}C'(w_1 \enum w_k)C''(w_{k+1} \enum w_n)\\
        =&\sum_{w_i\in\prod_{i=1}^{n}\{u_i,v_i\}}(-1)^{|\{w_i~|~w_i=u_i\}|}C'(w_1 \enum w_k)\\
        &\times C''(w_{k+1} \enum w_n)\\
        =&H
        \begin{matrix}
            v_1 \enum  v_n\\
            u_1 \enum  u_n
        \end{matrix}
        %=&H_{u_1 \enum  u_n}^{v_1 \enum  v_n}
    \end{align*}
\end{proof}
Using the result of \Cref{prop:hvol_factorizing}, we can now compute the joint mass as a product of two lower dimension copulas. It is easier to compute as we only integrate a $k$-dimensional function and a $n-k$-dimensional function, instead of a $n$-dimensional one. Similarly, the $H$ volume is not the sum of $2^{18}$ terms anymore, but the sum of $2^{k}$ and $2^{n-k}$ terms.

For comparison, consider that we can split the aforementioned Gaussian $18$-copula into two Gaussian $9$-copulas. Computing the value of a single mass naively takes around $10\,500s$, but now takes around $6s$, so around $1\,700$ times faster. This demonstrates the substantial time savings achieved by decomposing the problem into smaller, independent parts. These improvements apply directly to our application. Indeed, \Cref{eq:correlation} yields the following correlation between two pixels $p$, $q$ given the segmentation $S$:
\begin{equation*}
    \sigma(p, q) =
    \begin{cases}
        1 &\text{ if }p=q,\\
        \rho_k, &\text{ if } p\ne q\text{ and }S(p)=S(q)\,, \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}\,.
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
From this, we can split the set $\{p_1 \enum p_{18}\}$ of pixels in at most $K=8$ mutually independent sets $S_k = \{p_i~|~S(p_i)=k\}$, each set containing pixels from the same cluster. We can thus compute the H-volume of each cluster independently.

Another additional way of reducing the computation time is to avoid computing the same $H$-volume multiple times. Consider a set $S_k$ with $k_L$ pixels from the left image and $k_R$ pixels from the right image. The correlation matrix $R_k$ for this cluster is:
\begin{equation}
    R_k=\begin{pmatrix}
        1 &  & \rho_k & \ldots & \rho_k\\
         & & & & \vdots\\
        \rho_k &  & 1 & & \rho_k\\
        \vdots &  &  & & \\
        \rho_k & \ldots & \rho_k &  & 1
    \end{pmatrix}\label{eq:corr_matrix_sym}
\end{equation}
which implies that the Gaussian $(k_L+k_R)$-copula for this set is symmetrical. The joint mass $m^{S_k}_C$ of this set is then also symmetrical. Pixels from the left image will share the same mass $m_L$ for their two focal sets and pixel from the right image will also share the same mass $m_R$, therefore computing $m^{S_k}_C$ on every possible combination of cumulative masses is redundant. 
\begin{example}
    Let us imagine a set $S_k$ with $k_L=2$ pixels $p_1$, $p_2$ from the left image and $k_R=2$ pixels $p_3$, $p_4$ from the right image. Each pixel $p_i$ has two focal sets $a^i_1$ and $a^i_2$.
    We defined the mass distribution functions in \Cref{sec:uncertainty_models_for_epi_image} such that:
    \newline\medskip
    \begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
    	\begin{align*}
    		&m_L(a_1^1) &= m_L(a_1^2) \\
    		&m_R(a_1^3) &= m_R(a_1^4)
    	\end{align*}
    \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}{0.5\linewidth}
    	\begin{align*}
    		&m_L(a_2^1) = m_L(a_2^2)\\
    		&m_R(a_2^3) = m_R(a_2^4)
    	\end{align*}
    \end{minipage}\bigskip\newline
    Because of the symmetry of the Gaussian $4$-copula of the set $S_k$, the joint mass $m^{S_k}_C$ computed as the H-volume on cumulative masses (\Cref{eq:joint_mass}) verifies:
    \begin{align*}
        m^{S_k}_C(a_1^1, a_2^2, a_1^3, a_2^4) &= H
        \begin{matrix}
            m_L(a_1^1), & m_L(a_1^1)+m_L(a_2^2), & m_R(a_1^3), & m_R(a_1^4)+m_R(a_2^4)\\
            0, & m_L(a^2_1), & 0, & m_R(a_1^4)
        \end{matrix}\\
        &=H
        \begin{matrix}
            m_L(a_1^1)+m_L(a_2^1), & m_L(a_1^2), & m_R(a_1^3)+m_R(a_2^3), & m_R(a_1^4)\\
            m_L(a^1_1), & 0, & m_R(a_1^3), & 0
        \end{matrix}\\
        &\text{(by symmetry of the copula)}\\
        &= m^{S_k}_C(a_2^1, a_1^2, a_2^3, a_1^4)
    \end{align*}
    We can see that we do not need to compute $m^{S_k}_C$ on every possible combination of focal sets as many combinations have the same joint mass $m^{S_k}_C$.
\end{example}
For each set $S_k$, we only have to compute $(k_L+1)\cdot(k_R+1)$ values of $m^{S_k}_C$ rather than $2^{k_L+k_R}$.

We saw earlier that it was complex to compute the joint mass of the \acrshort{sad} in general. However, by taking advantage of the potential factorization of the copula into smaller copulas, and by leveraging some symmetries of the problem, we can greatly reduce the time and number of computations required.

\section{Results and Discussions}
In the previous section, we described how we can use $\M_{robust}$ and $\M_{mass}$ to propagate the uncertainty from the input images into the uncertainty of the \acrshort{sad}. Evaluating this uncertainty for every pixel and every considered disparity, results in the uncertainty models of every value of the cost volume (see \Cref{eq:cost_volume} from \Cref{sec:stereo_matching} for more details on the cost volume). We saw in \Cref{sec:necessity_functions} that $\M_{mass}$ and $\M_{robust}$ are different credal sets, and that neither set is guaranteed to be included in the other. This section will then compare the various models and see if $\M^Z_{mass}$ can be used to approximate $\M^Z_{robust}$. \Cref{sec:envelopes_plausibility} will present visualizations of  $\M^Z_{mass}$ using plausibility envelopes. \Cref{sec:montecarlo} will present visualizations of $\M^Z_{robust}$ using Monte Carlo samples and compare them to the plausibility envelopes. Finally, \Cref{sec:sad_improvements} will estimate the potential improvements unlocked by estimating the uncertainty.

\subsection{Envelopes Defined by Plausibility Levels}\label{sec:envelopes_plausibility}
Having defined efficient ways of computing the \acrshort{sad} focal sets in \Cref{sec:propagated_masses} and the joint mass in \Cref{sec:propagated_focal_sets}, we can determine the belief function $\Bel_\SAD$ associated with every estimation of the \acrshort{sad} between two $3\times3$ windows. $\Bel_\SAD$ is deducted from the mass $m^\SAD_C$ computed in \Cref{eq:mass_propagated}.

For each pixel $p_L=(\rowcol)$ in the left image and for each disparity $d$, we calculated the \acrshort{sad} cost between the window centered on $p_L$ in the left image and the window centered on $p_R=(\rowcol+d)$ in the right image. We are usually interested in going through each considered disparity $d$ to obtain the cost curve for pixel $p_L$. From this cost curve, a \textit{winner-takes-all} strategy is applied to find the correct disparity. Because of its significance, we aim to visualize the uncertainty of the entire cost curve, not just a single value.

It can be hard to graphically represent focal sets, or similarly belief functions, especially when there are many sets to consider. We are usually more keen to represent uncertainty on singletons, as we do with probability densities, possibility distributions or, to a certain extent, p-boxes (although in that case singletons represent cumulative events). Following that logic, we will consider the plausibility of singletons as a way of representing the uncertainty graphically.
\begin{remark}
    Considering the belief on singletons instead of the plausibility does not make much sense as the belief of singletons is very often null. The only exception is the precise \acrshort{sad} value, because it is the only singleton that is also a focal set.
\end{remark}
We will first explain how we graphically represent the uncertainty in the special case of possibility distributions, and then extend this representation to all \acrshort{sad} belief functions. 

As shown in \Cref{sec:propagated_focal_sets}, focal sets representing the \acrshort{sad} uncertainty are defined as intervals containing the ``precise'' \acrshort{sad} value. We saw in a remark from \Cref{sec:propagated_focal_sets} that the uncertainty of the \acrshort{sad} can be represented by a possibility distribution $\pi_\SAD$ in the special case where all $\AD$ leading to the \acrshort{sad} are greater than $2$. In this case, we can easily plot this possibility distribution, at least for a few degrees of possibility. Given a degree of possibility $\gamma$, we plot the bounds of the largest interval $I_\gamma=[\underline{I}_\gamma, \overline{I}_\gamma]$ whose possibility is greater than $\gamma$. It is the ``$\gamma$-cut'' defined in \Cref{def:alpha_cut}, which we then called ``$\alpha$-cut''. The possibility measure is computed as $\Pi_\SAD(A)=\sup_{z\in A}\pi_\SAD(z)$ or $\Pi_\SAD(A)=\sum_{a\cap A\neq\emptyset}m^\SAD_C(a)$ using \Cref{eq:bel_pl}. This way, given $\gamma\in[0,1]$, the bounds $\underline{I}_\gamma, \overline{I}_\gamma$ to plot are:
\begin{align}\label{eq:possibility_bounds}
    \underline{I}_\gamma = \argmin_{z}\{\pi_\SAD(z)\geqslant\gamma\}, \qquad \overline{I}_\gamma = \argmax_{z}\{\pi_\SAD(z)\geqslant\gamma\}
\end{align}
Because focal sets of $\pi_\SAD$ are increasing intervals, then every \acrshort{sad} value between $\underline{I}_\gamma$ and $\overline{I}_\gamma$ will have a possibility superior to $\gamma$. The bounds define the envelope of values with a degree of possibility greater than $\gamma$. Plotting envelopes for different values of $\gamma$ allows visualizing a representation of the \acrshort{sad} uncertainty. We will define the envelopes in the following, but readers can already have a broad idea of what those envelopes look like by looking at \Cref{fig:belief_curves}. 

In \Cref{eq:possibility_bounds}, $\underline{I}_\gamma$ and $\overline{I}_\gamma$ are the upper and lower bounds of the same focal set. If we relax this constraint, then we can extend this definition of $\underline{I}_\gamma, \overline{I}_\gamma$ to any type of \acrshort{sad} plausibility (or equivalently belief) function $\Pl_\SAD$. For all focal sets $a=[\underline{a}, \overline{a}]$ of the \acrshort{sad} plausibility function, the bounds $\underline{I}_\gamma, \overline{I}_\gamma$ are defined as:
\begin{align}\label{eq:belief_bounds}
    \underline{I}_\gamma = \min\{\underline{a} ~|~ \Pl_\SAD([\underline{a}, \overline{a}])\geqslant\gamma\}, \qquad \overline{I}_\gamma = \max\{\overline{a} ~|~ \Pl_\SAD([\underline{a}, \overline{a}])\geqslant\gamma\}
\end{align}

\begin{remark}
    \Cref{eq:belief_bounds} details how we chose to represent a plausibility function (or equivalently a credal set) by some envelopes. One can wonder if we can reconstruct the plausibility function from the envelopes. It is straightforward to see that it is the case if and only if the plausibility function is a possibility measure, because it is then fully determined by its values on singletons.
    
    However, if the plausibility is not a possibility measure, then the possibility distribution $\pi'$ defined by envelopes induces a credal set $\M(\pi')$ containing $\M(\Pl_\SAD)$. In that regard, we chose to represent a plausibility by an outer approximating possibility.
\end{remark}
Now that we decided on how to plot our uncertainty models, we can present some results. We arbitrarily considered different values for plausibility levels $\gamma$:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The first value is $\gamma=1$. It corresponds to the \acrshort{sad} value with the highest degree of possibility. This value is unique in our case, and corresponds to the \acrshort{sad} value that would have been computed without considering the uncertainty.
    \item We then consider values $\gamma=0.9$ and $\gamma=0.85$. They allow giving an estimation of the dispersion of envelopes with high plausibility. With them, we can estimate if highly plausible values are near the \acrshort{sad} values or not.
    \item $\gamma=0.5$ gives a moderate plausibility estimation. From a credal set point of view, the probability that the \acrshort{sad} value lies in this set is at least $0.5$.
    \item The last value is $\gamma=0$. For this value, the inequalities in \Cref{eq:belief_bounds} are actually strict (otherwise the inequality is verified by all imaginable values). These bounds represent the support of the plausibility function, or in other words, the range of values covered by focal sets.
\end{itemize}

A visualization of different plausibility levels of the \acrshort{sad} cost curve are displayed in \Cref{fig:belief_curves}, computed with the product copula $C_\Pi$ and a Gaussian copula $C_R$. The position of the considered pixel in the left image is displayed in \Cref{fig:cones_with_two_windows}. Both copulas have the same support $\Pl>0$, and the same value for $\Pl=1$. Envelopes of the other plausibility levels are however different. \Cref{fig:belief_independence_zoom} and \Cref{fig:belief_gaussian_zoom} display the fact that the values covered by the plausibility levels vary with the copula used. Plausibility levels $0.85$ and $0.5$ are more concentrated around plausibility level $1$ in the case of the product copula than in the case of the Gaussian copula. Conversely, plausibility level $0.9$ is closer to plausibility level $1$ in the case of the Gaussian copula. This is due to the fact that the Gaussian copula $C_R$ is more co-monotone than the product copula given the correlation matrix $R$ described in \Cref{eq:correlation_matrix}.
\begin{remark}
    Both the Gaussian and the product copula have the same support. This is because when computing the joint mass of marginal focal sets, the copula is regular enough to assign a non-null mass to every focal set. This would not have been the case if we took a copula close to the lower or upper Fr√©chet-Hoeffding bound (the lower bound is not a copula for $n>2$). Indeed, those copulas are less regular, and can assign a null mass to joint events, as we saw in the case of probabilities in \Cref{ex:copulas} and in \Cref{ex:propagated_probability}.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Estimating Propagated Credal Sets Using Monte Carlo Sampling}\label{sec:montecarlo}
In \Cref{chap:joining_credal_sets}, we defined $3$ methods for creating multivariate credal sets: $\M_{robust}$, $\M_{mass}$ and $\M_{agg}$. In the case where marginals were possibility distributions, we saw that the bounds of $\M_{agg}$ and $\M_{mass}$ were the same on Cartesian products, so we only considered $\M_{mass}$ in our application. In the previous sections, we propagated the uncertainty by using the approach from $\M_{mass}$. In this section, we will aim to estimate the propagated uncertainty using $\M_{robust}$, and compare it to previous results to evaluate whether we can use $\M_{mass}$ to outer/inner approximate $\M_{robust}$.

We remind here some definitions and results regarding $\M_{robust}$. $\M_{robust}$ is the convex hull $CH$ of the set of every \acrshort{cdf} from $n$ marginal credal sets $\M_i$ (in our case $n=18$, one per pixel involved in the \acrshort{sad} computation) joined with a copula $C$ (\Cref{eq:robust_set}):
\begin{align*}
    \M_{robust} = CH(\{F=C(F_1 \enum F_n),~F_i\in\M_i \})
\end{align*}
We can estimate $\M_{robust}$ using Monte Carlo samplings: we first generate marginal probability distributions $F_1\enum F_n$ belonging in their respective marginal credal sets \cite{troffaes_note_2017}, then sample from the joint \acrshort{cdf} $F$. More specifically, we sample a marginal \acrshort{cdf} $F_i$ belonging to the credal set defined in \Cref{eq:pixel_possibility}, for each of the $18$ considered pixels. Sampling from credal sets is not random: we generate probability distributions in such a way that for each marginal event $A$, the probability range $[\Nec(A), \Pi(A)]$ is sampled uniformly. With this method, we get a coverage of each marginal credal set. We are also ensuring that lower and upper bounds on events are reached at least once, in order to include ``extreme'' distributions in our simulations. Once we have a \acrshort{cdf} $F_i$ from each marginal credal set, we can sample from the joint \acrshort{cdf} using the method detailed in \Cref{sec:sampling_copula}. This yields a noised version of both left and right images, where the noised dependency is modeled by the provided copula, and its distribution is coherent with the possibility distributions from \Cref{eq:pixel_possibility}. We can then compute a noised version of the cost volume from those images. For each cost curve, this provides a Monte Carlo samples of the \acrshort{sad} cost curves.

We compute $10\,000$ samples \acrshort{cdf}s from each marginal credal set to construct the multivariate \acrshort{cdf}. Each multivariate \acrshort{cdf} is then itself sampled $10\,000$ times. The Central Limit Theorem states that $N$ Monte Carlo samples provide an approximation which has a precision of around $\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ (it also depends on the standard deviation of the \acrshort{pdf} you are estimating, but it is a good approximation), so $N=10\,000$ provides a satisfying precision for our application.  

In practice, we do not simulate a full noised pair of images at once, as it would be required to sample from a copula of very large dimension (the number of pixels in both images). This is not realistically feasible, even though it would ensure that each time a pixel is considered in the cost volume, the same noise samples are used. We instead generate noise samples for each row separately: noised values of pixels will not change during the evaluation of a cost curve for different disparities, or between the cost curves of pixels of the same row. However, their values might change between cost curves of pixels belonging to different rows. For instance, let's consider a pixel $p=(row,~col)\in I_L$ for which we computed a noised intensity $i_p$. We will use the same noised value $i_p$ of intensity when computing the \acrshort{sad} of every pixel $q=(row,~col')\in I_L$. But when computing the \acrshort{sad} of every pixel $q=(row-1,~col')\in I_L$, we will use a different Monte Carlo draw $i_p'$ for its intensity, which will remain the same for every pixel of row $row-1$. Because we draw $10^8$ Monte Carlo draws for each row, proceeding as such should not be noticeable. 

\begin{remark}
    As we construct the correlation matrices $R$ based on the segmentation of the left and right images, the cost curves displayed in \Cref{fig:montecarlo_gauss_100_120,fig:montecarlo_gauss_200_150} mostly use a different copula for each disparity. Providing the values of those matrices would necessitate to represent around $60$ $18\times18$ correlation matrices, and is thus not provided here.

Monte Carlo draws using the Gaussian copula and marginals credal sets of \Cref{eq:pixel_possibility} are plotted in \Cref{fig:montecarlo_gauss_100_120,fig:montecarlo_gauss_200_150}. They respectively correspond to the cost curves of pixel located at positions $(100,~120)$ and $(200,~150)$ on the left image, as displayed in \Cref{fig:cones_with_two_windows}. Plausibility levels computed using \Cref{eq:belief_bounds} (displayed in \Cref{fig:belief_curves}) also appear for comparison. The support envelopes from plausibility levels $\Pl>0$ correctly contain all Monte Carlo samplings for all considered copulas. We can observe in \Cref{fig:montecarlo_gauss_200_150_zoom2} that plausibility levels sometimes fail to correctly grasp the fluctuations of the dispersion of the samples, even though they correctly contain Monte Carlo samples. More specifically, Monte Carlo draws are first dense around disparity $-37$, then seem to spread around $-35$, and finally regather around disparity $-32$. The plausibility envelopes are more regular in this disparity range. This illustrates the fact that the ``true'' point-wise credal $\M_{robust}$ set described in \Cref{sec:robust_method} is different from the joint credal set $\M_{mass}$ from \Cref{sec:joint_mass}. 

Although some differences persist between those sets, \Cref{fig:montecarlo_gauss_100_120_zoom2,fig:montecarlo_gauss_200_150_zoom2} suggest that the point-wise credal set $\M_{robust}$ can be outer approximated by $\M_{mass}$ in our applications. To quantify this observation, we can compute the proportion of Monte Carlo samples contained inside the plausibility envelopes for different plausibility levels $\gamma$:
\begin{align}
    \textrm{coverage}_\gamma = \frac{\#\{\textrm{ Monte Carlo samples }\in[\underline{I}_\gamma,~\overline{I}_\gamma]\}}{\#\{\textrm{ Monte Carlo samples }\}}
\end{align}
The coverage for the considered values of $\gamma$ is presented in \Cref{tab:Coverage}, where the first two rows represent the coverage of \Cref{fig:montecarlo_gauss_100_120,fig:montecarlo_gauss_200_150}. The global coverage over the whole left image is presented in the last row of the table. The coverage is always $100\%$ for $\gamma=0$, which shows that every sample is contained inside the support envelopes, and that $\M_{robust}$ seems to be a subset of $\M_{mass}$. On the other hand, plausibility level $\gamma=0.5$ contain most Monte Carlo samples, which means that the bounds could be significantly reduced while still being a good estimation of $\M_{robust}$. Finally, the variation of the coverage for plausibility levels $0.85$ and $0.9$ translates the previous observation that $\M_{mass}$ does not capture the variations of $\M_{robust}$ bounds and that those two set can substantially differ. After estimating the uncertainty of the cost volume, we will see in the following section how we can leverage the upper and lower bounds for different plausibility levels to improve the disparity map derived from the cost volume.

\subsection{Leveraging Confidence Envelopes for Potential Improvements}\label{sec:sad_improvements}

Knowing the uncertainty, represented as confidence envelopes in our case, can provide valuable insights into potential matches. This section outlines different observations suggesting that incorporating this information can enhance the performance of stereo matching algorithms.

From the cost volume $C_V$, we usually apply a \textit{winner-takes-all} strategy to compute a disparity prediction. Given a pixel $(\rowcol)$, the predicted disparity $\tilde{d}$ is defined as:
\begin{align}\label{eq:winner_takes_all}
    \tilde{d}(\rowcol) = \argmin_{d}C_V(\rowcol, ~d)
\end{align}
A common metric for evaluating stereo algorithm performance is the proportion of pixels for which the absolute difference between the true disparity $d_{true}$ and the predicted disparity $\tilde{d}$ is less than one pixel. The score \( s \) is defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:score_d1}
    s = \frac{\#\{(\rowcol) \text{ such that } |d_{\mathrm{true}}(\rowcol) - \tilde{d}(\rowcol)| < 1\}}{\#\{(\rowcol)\}}\,.
\end{equation}
The ground truth disparity can be any real number in the disparity range, but as we only consider integer disparities, we consider a disparity to be ``correct'' if it is less than one pixel away from the true disparity.

Having computed envelopes $\underline{I}_\gamma$, $\overline{I}_\gamma$ on the cost volume for different plausibility levels $\gamma$, the cost curve is not unique anymore, and we can instead consider all cost curves $C_V^{\underline{I}_\gamma,\overline{I}_\gamma}$ contained within the plausibility envelopes. Instead of a single predicted disparity, we can now compute the set of all potential disparities, defined as the set of predicted disparities derived from every cost curve within the plausibility envelopes. Given a pixel $(\rowcol)$, a confidence level $\gamma \in [0, 1]$, and plausibility envelopes $\underline{I}_\gamma(\rowcol, ~d)$, $\overline{I}_\gamma(\rowcol, ~d)$, the set of potential disparities $D_\gamma^{\rowcol}$ is defined as:
\begin{align}
    D_\gamma^{\rowcol} = \{d~\mid&~ d=\argmin_\delta C_V^{\underline{I}_\gamma,\overline{I}_\gamma}(row,~col,~\delta),\\
    &\forall ~C_V^{\underline{I}_\gamma,\overline{I}_\gamma}(\rowcol, ~\delta)\in[\underline{I}_\gamma(\rowcol, ~\delta),~ \overline{I}_\gamma(\rowcol, ~\delta)]\}\nonumber
\end{align}
There is actually a simpler way of defining and computing $D_\gamma$, which is to notice that a disparity can be the minimum of a cost curve $C_V^{\underline{I}_\gamma,\overline{I}_\gamma}$ if and only if the lower bound $\underline{I}_\gamma$ for this disparity is less than the minimal value of the upper envelope $\overline{I}_\gamma$ :
\begin{equation}
    D_\gamma^{\rowcol} = \{d \mid \underline{I}_\gamma(\rowcol, ~d) \leq \min_\delta\overline{I}_\gamma(\rowcol, \delta)\}
\end{equation}
\Cref{fig:potential_disparities} provides a schematic example of $D_\gamma(\rowcol)$.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Images/Chap_4/Potentiel_disparities.png}
    \caption{Example of a set of potential disparities $D_\gamma$. The minimum of the upper envelope $\min\overline{I}_\gamma$ in dashed gray line. The vertical green line represents the true disparity.}
    \label{fig:potential_disparities}
\end{figure}

When the cost volume is considered without its uncertainty, many disparities are not correctly estimated by \Cref{eq:winner_takes_all}. We thus want to quantify the potential score improvements contained in the set of potential disparities $D_\gamma$. To do so, we consider that $D_\gamma$ is a potential improvement if it contains the true disparity $d_{true}$. From this we can compute the proportion of potential improvements $s_\gamma^{\text{opt}}$ over the whole image which is computed as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:optimal_score}
    s_\gamma^{\text{opt}} = \frac{\#\{(\rowcol) \mid \min_{d \in D_\gamma^{\rowcol}} |d_{\mathrm{true}}(\rowcol) - d| < 1\}}{\#\{(\rowcol)\}}
\end{equation}
In \Cref{fig:potential_disparities}, we can see that the predicted disparity $\tilde{d}$ is far away from the true disparity $d_{true}$, but the set of possible disparity $D_\gamma$ does indeed contain, the true disparity. This would have been counted as a potential improvement.

\begin{remark}
    \Cref{eq:optimal_score} defines the optimal score that \textit{could} have been obtained if we used an ideal cost volume contained in the envelopes. We do not provide a method for determining this ideal cost volume. In reality, even with a good strategy to leverage uncertainty information to obtain a better disparity map, the new score $s$ from \Cref{eq:score_d1} would be lower than $s_\gamma^{\text{opt}}$.
\end{remark}

The optimal score \( s_\gamma^{\text{opt}} \) can then be compared to the score $s$ computed without uncertainty from \Cref{eq:score_d1}. We therefore define the potential gain as \( \Delta s_\gamma = s_\gamma^{\text{opt}} - s \). $\Delta s_\gamma$ measures the proportion of pixel that benefit from the method, \ie pixels $(\rowcol)$ verifying:
\begin{equation}
    |d_{\mathrm{true}}(\rowcol) - \tilde{d}(\rowcol)| \geq 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \min_{d \in D_\gamma^{\rowcol}} |d_{\mathrm{true}}(\rowcol) - d| < 1
\end{equation}

Instances of computed optimal scores and potential gains for various $\gamma$ values are provided in \Cref{tab:optimal_score}. We can see that while the potential gain for $\gamma = 0.9$ is low, it increases significantly for lower values of $\gamma$. The base score is around $53\%$, which is a relatively low score for dense matching, but that was expected as we are using the \acrshort{sad} without \acrshort{sgm} regularization or additional post-processing. With $\gamma=0.85$, we could reach an optimal score of $67\%$, and using $\gamma=0.5$ or $\gamma=0$, the score could at best lie between $74\%$ and $82\%$. This is a quite significant improvement for a cost volume computed with the \acrshort{sad} cost function. For comparison, a \acrshort{sad} cost volume regularized with \acrshort{sgm} algorithm would have a score $s$ of $68\%$.

\Cref{fig:improvements} displays the spatial distribution of pixels that can benefit from this method. Pixels in occluded regions, \ie pixels present in one of the two images, are highlighted in orange. As occluded pixels cannot be improved as no true disparity exists, we do not consider them when computing the different statistics introduced in this section. Pixels where potential improvement can occur appear in blue.

We can see that pixels with potential improvements are not randomly distributed. These pixels are typically found in homogeneous areas where multiple disparities have low matching costs, similarly to the one represented in \Cref{fig:montecarlo_gauss_200_150_large}.

\begin{conclusion}
    In this Chapter, we modeled the uncertainty on stereo images and propagated it until the cost volume. We compared different methods from \Cref{chap:joining_credal_sets} for propagating the uncertainty, and evaluated the potential improvements unlocked by this uncertainty estimation. However, the stereo algorithm considered for computing the cost volume was intentionally simple to reduce the complexity of the problem. For the \acrshort{co3d} mission, different cost functions (CENSUS, MC-CNN) and \acrshort{sgm} regularization would instead be used. Furthermore, although the uncertainty of input images have an influence on the final uncertainty, the major part of the disparity map uncertainty comes from the processing uncertainty of the stereo algorithm itself. Quantifying and propagating this processing uncertainty will thus be the subject of \Cref{chap:epistemic_uncertainty}.
