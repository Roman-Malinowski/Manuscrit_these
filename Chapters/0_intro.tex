\chapter*{Introduction}
Nowadays, knowing Earth's topography is essential in many in Earth Observation activities (such as satellite images processing or hydrology), but also in urban planning, risk/damage assessment \etc In order to provide highly resoluted accurate models at low cost, we have witnessed the emergence of many stereo-photogrammetry solutions for image satellite.

The objective of this thesis is to investigate methods for estimating and propagating the uncertainty in a stereo pipeline. In the context of this thesis, we focused mainly on a pipeline developed by CNES, called CARS, which will be used for a mission dedicated to stereo-photogrammetry called CO3D.
