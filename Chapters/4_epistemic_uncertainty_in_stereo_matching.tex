\chapter{Epistemic uncertainty in stereo matching}
\section{Cost functions as expert opinions}
See everything from CVPR ?
\section{Processing in areas where cost functions cannot be trusted}
Ambiguity etc
\section{Propagation in the rest of the CARS pipeline}
Rasterization and small ideas with Gabriela?
