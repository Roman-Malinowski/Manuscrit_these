Before delving into the subject of this manuscript, we would like to give some advise on how to efficiently navigate through it. When writing this thesis, we made extensive use of the \textit{hyperref} package, so that reading it on a PDF viewer was made easier. You can thus click on citations, figure numbers, equation numbers, chapters and sections number, acronyms \etc to directly jump to the concerned part. When following a reference to a citation, a previous chapter, equations or figures located in a different part of the manuscript, it can be a laborious process to go back to the section you were reading. Depending on the OS of you computer and the app used to read the PDF document, there usually exist shortcuts to jump back to the previous view. This allows to quickly switch back and forth between chapters and sections.

For instance, imagine that you are in \Cref{chap:epistemic_uncertainty} and we make a reference to an equation form \Cref{chap:representation_of_uncertainty}. If you do not recall the equation, and quickly want to see what it is about, just click on the hyperlink to directly go to the relevant equation from \Cref{chap:representation_of_uncertainty}. Then use your system's shortcut to go back to where you were in \Cref{chap:epistemic_uncertainty}. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Using Acrobat Reader: the short cut \keys{\Altwin + \arrowkeyleft} (left arrow key) on Windows or Linux brings you to the previous view after clicking on a hyperlink. Afterwards, you can alternate views with \keys{\Altwin + \arrowkeyright} and \keys{\Altwin + \arrowkeyleft}. On MacOS, the \keys{\Altwin} key is replaced by the \keys{\cmd} key.
    \item Using Preview on MacOS, you can add the \menu{Page History} button to the toolbar, by right-clicking on the toolbar and selecting \menu{Customize Toolbar}
    \item Using Okular on Linux, \keys{\Altwin + \shift + \arrowkeyleft} (left arrow key) brings you to the previous view after clicking on a hyperlink. Afterwards, you can alternate views with \keys{\Altwin + \shift + \arrowkeyright} and \keys{\Altwin + \shift + \arrowkeyleft}
\end{itemize}
Hopefully, this makes the reading of this thesis a more pleasant experience.
