Then there are several ways to de{\textregistered}ne independence of the two experiments and to construct an imprecise probability model for the joint experiment. We survey and compare six de{\textregistered}nitions of independence. To clarify the meaning of the de{\textregistered}nitions and the relationships between them, we give simple examples which involve drawing balls from urns. For each concept of independence, we give a mathematical de{\textregistered}nition, an intuitive or behavioural interpretation, assumptions under which the de{\textregistered}nition is justi{\textregistered}ed, and an example of an urn model to which the de{\textregistered}nition is applicable. Each of the independence concepts we study appears to be useful in some kinds of application. The concepts of strong independence and epistemic independence appear to be the most frequently applicable.},

The stereo Markov network consists of three coupled Markov random fields that model the following: a smooth field for depth/disparity, a line process for depth discontinuity, and a binary process for occlusion. After eliminating the line process and the binary process by introducing two robust functions, we apply the belief propagation algorithm to obtain the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation in the Markov network. Other low-level visual cues (e.g., image segmentation) can also be easily incorporated in our stereo model to obtain better stereo results. Experiments demonstrate that our methods are comparable to the state-of-the-art stereo algorithms for many test cases.},

The evaluation of the disparity map can be done through the estimation of a confidence metric. In this article, we propose a new confidence metric, named ambiguity integral metric, to assess the quality of the produced disparity map. This metric is derived from the concept of ambiguity, which characterizes the property of the cost curve profile. It aims to quantify the difficulty in identifying the correct disparity to select. The quality of ambiguity integral metric is evaluated through the ROC curve methodology and compared with other confidence measures. In regards to other measures, the ambiguity integral measure shows a good potential. We also integrate this measure through various steps of the stereo matching pipeline in order to improve the performance estimation of the disparity map. First, we include ambiguity integral measure during the Semi Global Matching optimization step. The objective is to weight, by ambiguity integral measure, the influence of points in the SGM regularization to reduce the impact of ambiguous points. Secondly, we use ambiguity as an input of a disparity refinement deep learning architecture in order to easily locate noisy area and preserve details.},

	abstract = {Estimating risks of groundwater contamination often require schemes for representing and propagating uncertainties relative to model input parameters. The most popular method is the Monte Carlo method whereby cumulative probability distributions are randomly sampled in an iterative fashion. The shortcoming of the approach, however, arises when probability distributions are arbitrarily selected in situations where available information is incomplete or imprecise. In such situations, alternative modes of information representation can be used, for example the nested intervals known as {\textquotedblleft}possibility distributions{\textquotedblright}. In practical situations of groundwater risk assessment, it is common that certain model parameters may be represented by single probability distributions (representing variability) because there are data to justify these distributions, while others are more faithfully represented by possibility distributions (representing imprecision) due to the partial nature of available information. This paper applies two recent methods, designed for the joint-propagation of variability and imprecision, to a groundwater contamination risk assessment. Results of the joint-propagation methods are compared to those obtained using both interval analysis and the Monte Carlo method with a hypothesis of stochastic independence between model parameters. The two joint-propagation methods provide results in the form of families of cumulative distributions of the probability of exceeding a certain value of groundwater concentration. These families are delimited by an upper cumulative distribution and a lower distribution respectively called Plausibility and Belief after evidence theory. Slight differences between the results of the two joint-propagation methods are explained by the different assumptions regarding parameter dependencies. Results highlight the point that non-conservative results may be obtained if single cumulative probability distributions are arbitrarily selected for model parameters in the face of imprecise information and the Monte Carlo method is used under the assumption of stochastic independence. The proposed joint-propagation methods provide upper and lower bounds for the probability of exceeding a tolerance threshold. As this may seem impractical in a risk-management context, it is proposed to introduce {\textquotedblleft}a-posteriori subjectivity{\textquotedblright} (as opposed to the {\textquotedblleft}a-priori subjectivity{\textquotedblright} introduced by the arbitrary selection of single probability distributions) by defining a single indicator of evidence as a weighted average of Plausibility and Belief, with weights to be defined according to the specific context.},

	abstract = {In recent years, taking photos and capturing videos with mobile devices have become increasingly popular. Emerging applications based on the depth reconstruction technique have been developed, such as Google lens blur. However, depth reconstruction is difficult due to occlusions, non-diffuse surfaces, repetitive patterns, and textureless surfaces, and it has become more difficult due to the unstable image quality and uncontrolled scene condition in the mobile setting. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical framework with multi-view confidence-based matching for robust, efficient depth reconstruction in uncontrolled scenes. Particularly, the proposed framework combines local cost aggregation with global cost optimization in a complementary manner that increases efficiency and accuracy. A depth map is efficiently obtained in a coarse-to-fine manner by using an image pyramid. Moreover, confidence maps are computed to robustly fuse multi-view matching cues, and to constrain the stereo matching on a finer scale. The proposed framework has been evaluated with challenging indoor and outdoor scenes, and has achieved robust and efficient depth reconstruction.},

	abstract = {Motivated by the need to identify erroneous disparity assignments, various approaches for uncertainty and confidence estimation of dense stereo matching have been presented in recent years. As in many other fields, especially deep learning based methods have shown convincing results. However, most of these methods only model the uncertainty contained in the data, while ignoring the uncertainty of the employed dense stereo matching procedure. Additionally modelling the latter, however, is particularly beneficial if the domain of the training data varies from that of the data to be processed. For this purpose, in the present work the idea of probabilistic deep learning is applied to the task of dense stereo matching for the first time. Based on the well-known and commonly employed GC-Net architecture, a novel probabilistic neural network is presented, for the task of joint depth and uncertainty estimation from epipolar rectified stereo image pairs. Instead of learning the network parameters directly, the proposed probabilistic neural network learns a probability distribution from which parameters are sampled for every prediction. The variations between multiple such predictions on the same image pair allow to approximate the model uncertainty. The quality of the estimated depth and uncertainty information is assessed in an extensive evaluation on three different datasets.},

Especially, the introduction of deep learning based methods and the accompanying significant improvement in accuracy have greatly increased the popularity of this field. Despite this remarkable development, most of these methods rely on features learned from disparity maps only, neglecting the corresponding 3-dimensional cost volumes. However, conventional hand-crafted methods have already demonstrated that the additional information contained in such cost volumes are beneficial for the task of uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we combine the advantages of deep learning and cost volume based features and present a new Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to directly learn features for the task of aleatoric uncertainty estimation from volumetric 3D data. Furthermore, we discuss and apply three different uncertainty models to train our CNN without the need to provide ground truth for uncertainty. In an extensive evaluation on three datasets using three common dense stereo matching methods, we investigate the effects of these uncertainty models and demonstrate the generality and state-of-the-art accuracy of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have shown that cascade cost volume can play a vital role in deep stereo matching to achieve high resolution depth map with efficient hardware usage. However, how to construct good cascade volume as well as effective sampling for them are still under in-depth study. Previous cascade-based methods usually perform uniform sampling in a predicted disparity range based on variance, which easily misses the ground truth disparity and decreases disparity map accuracy. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty adaptive sampling network (UASNet) featuring two modules: an uncertainty distributionguided range prediction (URP) model and an uncertaintybased disparity sampler (UDS) module. The URP explores the more discriminative uncertainty distribution to handle the complex matching ambiguities and to improve disparity range prediction. The UDS adaptively adjusts sampling interval to localize disparity with improved accuracy. With the proposed modules, our UASNet learns to construct cascade cost volume and predict full-resolution disparity map directly. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves the highest ground truth covering ratio compared with other cascade cost volume based stereo matching methods. Our method also achieves top performance on both SceneFlow dataset and KITTI benchmark.},

Occlusions are detected and disparities determined with sub-pixel accuracy. Additionally, an extension for multi-baseline stereo images is presented. There are two novel contributions. Firstly, a hierarchical calculation of Mutual Information based matching is shown, which is almost as fast as intensity based matching. Secondly, an approximation of a global cost calculation is proposed that can be performed in a time that is linear to the number of pixels and disparities.

If, on the other hand, the window i{\textbackslash} too large and covers a region in which the depth of scene points (i.e., disparity) varies, then the position of maximum correlation or minimum SSD may not represent correct matching due to different projective distortions in the left and right images. For this reason, a window size must be selected adaptively depending on local variations of intensity and disparity.},

Nevertheless, it suffers of two major issues: streaking artifacts caused by the Scanline Optimization (SO) approach, at the core of this algorithm, may lead to inaccurate results and the high memory footprint that may become prohibitive with high resolution images or devices with constrained resources. In this paper, we propose a smart scanline aggregation approach for SGM aimed at dealing with both issues. In particular, the contribution of this paper is threefold: i) leveraging on machine learning, proposes a novel generalpurpose confidence measure suited for any for stereo algorithm, based on O(1) features, that outperforms stateof-the-art ii) taking advantage of this confidence measure proposes a smart aggregation strategy for SGM enabling significant improvements with a very small overhead iii) the overall strategy drastically reduces the memory footprint of SGM and, at the same time, improves its effectiveness and execution time.

	abstract = {The generation of digital surface models (DSMs) from multi-view high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery has recently received a great attention due to the increasing availability of such space-based datasets. Existing production-level pipelines primarily adopt a multi-view stereo (MVS) paradigm, which exploit the statistical depth fusion of multiple DSMs generated from individual stereo pairs. To make this process scalable, these depth fusion methods often adopt simple approaches such as the median filter or its variants, which are efficient in computation but lack the flexibility to adapt to heterogenous information of individual pixels. These simple fusion approaches generally discard ancillary information produced by MVS algorithms (such as measurement confidence/uncertainty) that is otherwise extremely useful to enable adaptive fusion. To make use of such information, this paper proposes an efficient and scalable approach that incorporates the matching uncertainty to adaptively guide the fusion process. This seemingly straightforward idea has a higher-level advantage: first, the uncertainty information is obtained from global/semiglobal matching methods, which inherently populate global information of the scene, making the fusion process nonlocal. Secondly, these globally determined uncertainties are operated locally to achieve efficiency for processing large-sized images, making the method extremely practical to implement. The proposed method can exploit results from stereo pairs with small intersection angles to recover details for areas where dense buildings and narrow streets exist, but also to benefit from highly accurate 3D points generated in flat regions under large intersection angles. The proposed method was applied to DSMs generated from Worldview, GeoEye, and Pleiades stereo pairs covering a large area (400 km2). Experiments showed that we achieved an RMSE (root-mean-squared error) improvement of approximately 0.1{\textendash}0.2 m over a typical Median Filter approach for fusion (equivalent to 5{\textendash}10\% of relative accuracy improvement).},

Non-parametric local transforms rely on the relative ordering of local intensity values, and not on the intensity values themselves. Correlation using such transforms can tolerate a significant number of outliers. This can result in improved performance near object boundaries when compared with conventional methods such as normalized correlation. We introduce two non-parametric local transforms: the rank transform, which measures local intensity, and the census transform, which summarizes local image structure. We describe some properties of these transforms, and demonstrate their utility on both synthetic and real data.},

Conversely to other tasks such as disparity estimation, the uncertainty of confidence directly hints that the confidence should be increased if initially low, but with high uncertainty, decreased otherwise. By modelling such a cue in the form of a second-level confidence, or meta-confidence, our solution allows for finding incorrect predictions inferred by confidence estimator and for learning a correction for them. Our strategy is suited for any state-of-the-art method known in literature, either implemented using random forest classifiers or deep neural networks. Especially, for deep neural networksbased models, we present a multi-headed confidence estimator followed by an uncertainty network, so as to predict mean confidence and meta-confidence within a single network without the cost of lower accuracy, a known limitation in literature for uncertainty estimation. Experimental results on a variety of stereo algorithms and confidence estimation models prove that the modeled meta-confidence is meaningful of the reliability of the estimated confidence and allows for refining it.},

	abstract = {The monitoring of Earth{\textquoteright}s and planetary surface elevations at larger and finer scales is rapidly progressing through the increasing availability and resolution of digital elevation models (DEMs). Surface elevation observations are being used across an expanding range of fields to study topographical attributes and their changes over time, notably in glaciology, hydrology, volcanology, seismology, forestry, and geomorphology. However, DEMs frequently contain large-scale instrument noise and varying vertical precision that lead to complex patterns of errors. Here, we present a validated statistical workflow to estimate, model, and propagate uncertainties in DEMs. We review the state-of-the-art of DEM accuracy and precision analyses, and define a conceptual framework to consistently address those. We show how to characterize DEM precision by quantifying the heteroscedasticity of elevation measurements, i.e., varying vertical precision with terrainor sensor-dependent variables, and the spatial correlation of errors that can occur across multiple spatial scales. With the increasing availability of high-precision observations, our workflow based on independent elevation data acquired on stable terrain can be applied almost anywhere on Earth. We illustrate how to propagate uncertainties for both pixel-scale and spatial elevation derivatives, using terrain slope and glacier volume changes as examples. We find that uncertainties in DEMs are largely underestimated in the literature, and advocate that new metrics of DEM precision are essential to ensure the reliability of future land elevation assessments.},

This information proves to be a powerful cue to naively find wrong matches as well as to improve the overall effectiveness of a variety of stereo algorithms according to different strategies.

We extensively discuss and evaluate existing confidence measures and their variants, from hand-crafted ones to the most recent, state-of-the-art learning based methods.

	abstract = {To date, there is no definitive approach to map snow depth in mountainous areas from spaceborne sensors. Here, we examine the potential of very-high-resolution (VHR) optical stereo satellites to this purpose. Two triplets of 0.70 m resolution images were acquired by the Pl{\'e}iades satellite over an open alpine catchment (14.5 km2) under snowfree and snow-covered conditions. The open-source software Ame{\textquoteright}s Stereo Pipeline (ASP) was used to match the stereo pairs without ground control points to generate raw photogrammetric clouds and to convert them into high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) at 1, 2, and 4 m resolutions. The DEM differences (dDEMs) were computed after 3-D coregistration, including a correction of a -0.48 m vertical bias. The bias-corrected dDEM maps were compared to 451 snow-probe measurements. The results show a decimetric accuracy and precision in the Pl{\'e}iades-derived snow depths. The median of the residuals is -0.16 m, with a standard deviation (SD) of 0.58 m at a pixel size of 2 m. We compared the 2 m Pl{\'e}iades dDEM to a 2 m dDEM that was based on a winged unmanned aircraft vehicle (UAV) photogrammetric survey that was performed on the same winter date over a portion of the catchment (3.1 km2). The UAV-derived snow depth map exhibits the same patterns as the Pl{\'e}iades-derived snow map, with a median of -0.11 m and a SD of 0.62 m when compared to the snow-probe measurements. The Pl{\'e}iades images benefit from a very broad radiometric range (12 bits), allowing a high correlation success rate over the snowcovered areas. This study demonstrates the value of VHR stereo satellite imagery to map snow depth in remote mountainous areas even when no field data are available.},

	abstract = {Estimating depth from RGB images is a long-standing ill-posed problem, which has been explored for decades by the computer vision, graphics, and machine learning communities. Among the existing techniques, stereo matching remains one of the most widely used in the literature due to its strong connection to the human binocular system. Traditionally, stereo-based depth estimation has been addressed through matching hand-crafted features across multiple images. Despite the extensive amount of research, these traditional techniques still suffer in the presence of highly textured areas, large uniform regions, and occlusions. Motivated by their growing success in solving various 2D and 3D vision problems, deep learning for stereo-based depth estimation has attracted a growing interest from the community, with more than 150 papers published in this area between 2014 and 2019. This new generation of methods has demonstrated a significant leap in performance, enabling applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of this new and continuously growing field of research, summarize the most commonly used pipelines, and discuss their benefits and limitations. In retrospect of what has been achieved so far, we also conjecture what the future may hold for deep learning-based stereo for depth estimation research.},

To our knowledge, this is the first such method reported in the literature. Starting from a simple superpixel stereo algorithm, we present a representative set of features that can be extracted from the disparity map and the superpixel fitting process. A random forest classifier is then trained on these features to predict whether the disparity assigned to each pixel of a test disparity map is correct or not. We perform experiments on the KITTI stereo benchmark and show that our confidence estimator is very accurate in predicting which disparities are correct and which are not. We also present a post-processing algorithm for improving the accuracy of the disparity maps that exploits the confidence estimates to reject wrong disparity values and achieves significant error reduction.},

Initially, depth data acquired by the ToF camera are upsampled by an ad-hoc algorithm based on image segmentation and bilateral filtering. In parallel a dense disparity map is obtained using the SemiGlobal Matching stereo algorithm. Reliable confidence measures are extracted for both the ToF and stereo depth data. In particular, ToF confidence also accounts for the mixed-pixel effect and the stereo confidence accounts for the relationship between the pointwise matching costs and the cost obtained by the semi-global optimization. Finally, the two depth maps are synergically fused by enforcing the local consistency of depth data accounting for the confidence of the two data sources at each location. Experimental results clearly show that the proposed method produces accurate high resolution depth maps and outperforms the compared fusion algorithms.},

Thus, heuristic disparity refinement techniques are usually deployed to improve accuracy. Moreover, stateof-the-art methods rely on complex CNNs requiring power hungry GPUs not suited for many practical applications constrained by limited computing resources. In this paper, we propose a novel technique for disparity refinement leveraging on confidence measures and a novel, automatic learning-based selection method to discard outliers. Then, a non-local strategy infers missing disparities by analyzing the closest reliable points. This framework is very fast and does not require any hand-tuned thresholding. We assess the performance of our Non-Local Anchoring (NLA), standalone refinement techniques and methods leveraging on confidence measures inside the stereo algorithm. Our evaluation with two popular stereo algorithms shows that our proposal significantly ameliorates their accuracy on Middlebury v3 and KITTI 2015 datasets. Moreover, since our method relies only on cues computed in the disparity domain, it is suited even for COTS stereo cameras coupled with embedded systems, e.g. nVidia Jetson TX2.},

	abstract = {In the present work, an uncertainty-driven geometry-based regularisation for the task of dense stereo matching is presented. The objective of the regularisation is the reduction of ambiguities in the depth reconstruction process, which exist due to the ill-posed nature of this task. Based on cost and uncertainty information computed beforehand, pixels are selected, whose depth information can be determined correctly with a high probability. This depth information assumed to be of high confidence is initially used to construct a triangle mesh, which is interpreted as surface approximation of the imaged scene and allows to propagate the confident depth information of the triangle vertices within local neighbourhoods. The proposed method further computes confidence scores for propagated depth estimates, which are used to fuse this depth information with the previously computed cost information, introducing a regularisation into the data term of global optimisation methods. Furthermore, based on the propagated depth information the local smoothness assumption of global optimisation methods is adjusted. Instead of fronto-parallel planes, the method presumes planes, which are parallel to the propagated depth information. The performance of the proposed regularisation approach is evaluated in combination with a global optimisation method. For a quantitative and qualitative evaluation two commonly employed and well-established stereo datasets are used. The proposed method shows significant improvements in accuracy on both datasets and for two different cost computation methods. Especially in unstructured areas, artefacts in the disparity maps are reduced.},

We also propose several modifications to the original Semi-Global algorithm to improve the sub-pixel accuracy and the execution time. One of these proposals is the reduction in the number of optimization directions without affecting the results. The second modification is a correction of the energy function to reduce the spread of depth values. Besides these improvements, the paper also introduces a new aggregation method used to reduce the spread of sub-pixel values. Finally we propose a new method to generate sub-pixel interpolation functions based on real-world data. The result of these enhancements is a significant improvement in sub-pixel accuracy.

	abstract = {The amount of very high resolution optical satellite images at our disposal is continuously increasing. Besides, associated satellite programs often come with high revisit rates and geometric properties that allow for either opportunistic or by-design 3D stereo reconstruction. Digital Surface Models (DSM) computed from these satellite images offer new possibilities. In the past, the high revisit rate has largely benefited glacier monitoring studies. Now, DSM with increased resolution provided on urban areas can be used for smart city applications as well. However, most of these require 3D modeling of buildings with level of details ranging from 0 to 2. This is where the need for better reconstructed buildings inside DSM arises. Indeed, building edges and corners tend to be smoothed and softened by the stereo matching step of a DSM computation pipeline. This undesired behavior can mostly be linked to the difficult task of optimizing the Disparity Space Image, thus finding good balance between smoothing untextured areas while conserving sharp discontinuities where needed. In this paper, we show how the optimization can benefit from an input building semantic segmentation. We also provide a method to create it from a very high satellite image in epipolar geometry using a convolutional neural network. To help our network generalize well on unseen areas we propose an interactive learning method based on clicked annotations. Eventually, we show that annotations can be automatically created, hence removing the need for an operator and making our solution suitable for operational conditions.},

The accuracy and speed of SGM are the main reasons for its widespread adoption, even when applied to generic problems beyond stereovision. This approximate minimization, however, also produces characteristic low amplitude streaks in the final disparity image, and is clearly suboptimal with respect to more comprehensive minimization strategies.},

	abstract = {Abstract. In response to climate change, most glaciers are losing mass and hence contribute to sea-level rise. Repeated and accurate mapping of their surface topography is required to estimate their mass balance and to extrapolate/calibrate sparse field glaciological measurements. In this study we evaluate the potential of sub-meter stereo imagery from the recently launched Pl{\'e}iades satellites to derive digital elevation models (DEMs) of glaciers and their elevation changes. Our five evaluation sites, where nearly simultaneous field measurements were collected, are located in Iceland, the European Alps, the central Andes, Nepal and Antarctica. For Iceland, the Pl{\'e}iades DEM is also compared to a lidar DEM. The vertical biases of the Pl{\'e}iades DEMs are less than 1 m if ground control points (GCPs) are used, but reach up to 7 m without GCPs. Even without GCPs, vertical biases can be reduced to a few decimetres by horizontal and vertical co-registration of the DEMs to reference altimetric data on ice-free terrain. Around these biases, the vertical precision of the Pl{\'e}iades DEMs is {\textpm}1 m and even {\textpm}0.5 m on the flat glacier tongues (1$\sigma$ confidence level). Similar precision levels are obtained in the accumulation areas of glaciers and in Antarctica. We also demonstrate the high potential of Pl{\'e}iades DEMs for measuring seasonal, annual and multi-annual elevation changes with an accuracy of 1 m or better if cloud-free images are available. The negative region-wide mass balances of glaciers in the Mont-Blanc area (-1.04 {\textpm} 0.23 m a-1 water equivalent, w.e.) are revealed by differencing Satellite pour l'Observation de la Terre 5 (SPOT 5) and Pl{\'e}iades DEMs acquired in August 2003 and 2012, confirming the accelerated glacial wastage in the European Alps.},

	abstract = {There are an increasing number of digital elevation models (DEMs) available worldwide for deriving elevation differences over time, including vertical changes on glaciers. Most of these DEMs are heavily post-processed or merged, so that physical error modelling becomes difficult and statistical error modelling is required instead. We propose a three-step methodological framework for assessing and correcting DEMs to quantify glacier elevation changes: (i) remove DEM shifts, (ii) check for elevation-dependent biases, and (iii) check for higher-order, sensor-specific biases. A simple, analytic and robust method to co-register elevation data is presented in regions where stable terrain is either plentiful (case study New Zealand) or limited (case study Svalbard). The method is demonstrated using the three global elevation data sets available to date, SRTM, ICESat and the ASTER GDEM, and with automatically generated DEMs from satellite stereo instruments of ASTER and SPOT5HRS. After 3-D co-registration, significant biases related to elevation were found in some of the stereoscopic DEMs. Biases related to the satellite acquisition geometry (along/cross track) were detected at two frequencies in the automatically generated ASTER DEMs. The higher frequency bias seems to be related to satellite jitter, most apparent in the backlooking pass of the satellite. The origins of the more significant lower frequency bias is uncertain. ICESat-derived elevations are found to be the most consistent globally available elevation data set available so far. Before performing regional-scale glacier elevation change studies or mosaicking DEMs from multiple individual tiles (e.g. ASTER GDEM), we recommend to co-register all elevation data to ICESat as a global vertical reference system.},

	abstract = {The increasing availability of high resolution stereo images from Earth observation satellites has boosted the development of tools for producing 3D elevation models. The objective of these tools is to produce digital elevation models of very large areas with minimal human intervention. The development of these tools has been shaped by the constraints of the remote sensing acquisition, for example, using ad hoc stereo matching tools to deal with the pushbroom image geometry. However, this specialization has also created a gap with respect to the fields of computer vision and image processing, where these constraints are usually factored out. In this work we propose a fully automatic and modular stereo pipeline to produce digital elevation models from satellite images. The aim of this new pipeline, called Satellite Stereo Pipeline and abbreviated as s2p, is to use (and test) off-the-shelf computer vision tools while abstracting from the complexity associated to satellite imaging. To this aim, images are cut in small tiles for which we proved that the pushbroom geometry is very accurately approximated by the pinhole model. These tiles are then processed with standard stereo image rectification and stereo matching tools. The specifics of satellite imaging such as pointing accuracy refinement, estimation of the initial elevation from SRTM data, and geodetic coordinate systems are handled transparently by s2p. We demonstrate the robustness of our approach on a large database of satellite images and by providing an online demo of s2p.},

The use of physics-based models of natural hazards in risk-informed planning and decision-making frameworks may provide an improved understand- ing of site-specific hazard scenarios, allowing various decision makers to more accurately consider the consequences of their decisions on risks in future development. We present results of physics-based simulations of flood, earthquake, and debris flow scenarios in a virtual urban testbed. The effect of climate change, in terms of increasing rainfall intensity, is also incorporated into some of the considered hazard scenarios. We use our results to highlight the importance of using physics-based models applied to high-resolution urban plans to provide dynamic hazard information at the building level for different development options. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that including building elevations into digital elevation models is crucial for pre- dicting the routing of hazardous flows through future urban landscapes. We show that simula- tions of multiple, independent hazards can assist with the identification of developing urban regions that are vulnerable to potential multi-hazard events. This information can direct further modelling to provide decision-makers with insights into potential multi-hazard events. Finally, we reflect on how information derived from physics-based hazard models can be effectively used in risk-sensitive planning and decision-making.},

	abstract = {Orthorectification of satellite data is one of the most important pre-processing steps for application oriented evaluations and for image data input into Geographic Information Systems. Although highand very high-resolution optical data can be rectified without ground control points (GCPs) using an underlying digital elevation model (DEM) to positional root mean square errors (RMSEs) between 3 m and several hundred meters (depending on the satellite), there is still need for ground control with higher precision to reach lower RMSE values for the orthoimages. The very high geometric accuracy of geocoded data of the TerraSAR-X satellite has been shown in several investigations. This is due to the fact that the SAR antenna measures distances which are mainly dependent on the terrain height and the position of the satellite. The latter can be measured with high precision, whereas the satellite attitude need not be known exactly. If the used DEM is of high accuracy, the resulting geocoded SAR data are very precise in their geolocation. This precision can be exploited to improve the orientation knowledge and thereby the geometric accuracy of the rectified optical satellite data. The challenge is to match two kinds of image data, which exhibit very different geometric and radiometric properties. Simple correlation techniques do not work and the goal is to develop a robust method which works even for urban areas, including radar shadows, layover and foreshortening effects. First the optical data have to be rectified with the available interior and exterior orientation data or using rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs). From this approximation, the technique used is the measurement of small identical areas in the optical and radar images by automatic image matching, using a newly developed adapted mutual information procedure followed by an estimation of correction terms for the exterior orientation or the RPC coefficients. The matching areas are selected randomly from a regular grid covering the whole imagery. By adjustment calculations, parameters from falsely matched areas can be eliminated and optimal improvement parameters are found. The original optical data are orthorectified again using the delivered metadata together with these corrections and the available DEM. As proof of method the orthorectified data from IKONOS and ALOS-PRISM sensors are compared with conventional ground control information from high-precision orthoimage maps of the German Cartographic Survey. The results show that this method is robust, even for urban areas. Although the resulting RMSE values are in the order of 2{\textendash}6 m, the advantage is that this result can be reached even for optical sensors which do not exhibit low RMSE values without using manual GCP measurements.},

	abstract = {Abstract. LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is a laser altimeter system that determines the distance by measuring pulse travel time. The data from the LIDAR systems provide unique information on the vertical structure of land covers. Compared to ground-based and airborne LIDARs providing a high-resolution digital surface model, space-borne LIDARs can provide important information about the vertical profile of the atmosphere in a global scale. The overall objective of these satellites is to study the elevation changes and the vertical distribution of clouds and aerosols. In this paper an overview on the space-borne laser scanner satellites are accomplished and their applications are introduced. The first space-borne LIDAR is the ICESat (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite) satellite carrying the GLAS instrument which was launched in January 2003. The CALIPSO (the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations, 2006), CATS-ISS (the Cloud-Aerosol Transport System, 2015), ADM-Aeolus (Atmospheric Dynamics Mission, 2018), and ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2, 2018) satellites were respectively lunched and began to receive information about the vertical structure of the atmosphere and land cover. In addition, two ACE (The Aerosol-Cloud-Ecosystems, 2022) and EarthCARE (Earth Clouds, Aerosols and Radiation Explorer, 2021) space-borne satellites were planned for future. The data of the satellites are increasingly utilized to improve the numerical weather predictions (NWP) and climate modeling.},

	title = {Digital elevation model error in terrain analysis},
	abstract = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) have been an important topic in geography and surveying sciences for decades due to their geomorphological importance as the reference surface for gravitation-driven material flow, as well as the wide range of uses and applications. When DEM is used in terrain analysis, for example in automatic drainage basin delineation, errors of the model collect in the analysis results. Investigation of this phenomenon is known as error propagation analysis, which has a direct influence on the decision-making process based on interpretations and applications of terrain analysis. Additionally, it may have an indirect influence on data acquisition and the DEM generation. The focus of the thesis was on the fine toposcale DEMs, which are typically represented in a 5{\textendash}50m grid and used in the application scale 1:10 000{\textendash}1:50 000. The thesis presents a three-step framework for investigating error propagation in DEM-based terrain analysis. The framework includes methods for visualising the morphological gross errors of DEMs, exploring the statistical and spatial characteristics of the DEM error, making analytical and simulation-based error propagation analysis and interpreting the error propagation analysis results. The DEM error model was built using geostatistical methods. The results show that appropriate and exhaustive reporting of various aspects of fine toposcale DEM error is a complex task. This is due to the high number of outliers in the error distribution and morphological gross errors, which are detectable with presented visualisation methods. In addition, the use of global characterisation of DEM error is a gross generalisation of reality due to the small extent of the areas in which the decision of stationarity is not violated. This was shown using exhaustive high-quality reference DEM based on airborne laser scanning and local semivariogram analysis. The error propagation analysis revealed that, as expected, an increase in the DEM vertical error will increase the error in surface derivatives. However, contrary to expectations, the spatial autocorrelation of the model appears to have varying effects on the error propagation analysis depending on the application. The use of a spatially uncorrelated DEM error model has been considered as a {\textquoteleft}worst-case scenario{\textquoteright}, but this opinion is now challenged because none of the DEM derivatives investigated in the study had maximum variation with spatially uncorrelated random error. Significant performance improvement was achieved in simulation-based error propagation analysis by applying process convolution in generating realisations of the DEM error model. In addition, typology of uncertainty in drainage basin delineations is presented.},

            High-resolution raster hydrography maps are a fundamental data source for many geoscience applications. Here we introduce MERIT Hydro, a new global flow direction map at 3-arc sec resolution ({\textasciitilde}90 m at the equator) derived from the latest elevation data (MERIT DEM) and water body data sets (G1WBM, Global Surface Water Occurrence, and OpenStreetMap). We developed a new algorithm to extract river networks near automatically by separating actual inland basins from dummy depressions caused by the errors in input elevation data. After a minimum amount of hand editing, the constructed hydrography map shows good agreement with existing quality-controlled river network data sets in terms of flow accumulation area and river basin shape. The location of river streamlines was realistically aligned with existing satellite-based global river channel data. Relative error in the drainage area was {\textless}0.05 for 90\% of Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC) gauges, confirming the accuracy of the delineated global river networks. Discrepancies in flow accumulation area were found mostly in arid river basins containing depressions that are occasionally connected at high water levels and thus resulting in uncertain watershed boundaries. MERIT Hydro improves on existing global hydrography data sets in terms of spatial coverage (between N90 and S60) and representation of small streams, mainly due to increased availability of high-quality baseline geospatial data sets. The new flow direction and flow accumulation maps, along with accompanying supplementary layers on hydrologically adjusted elevation and channel width, will advance geoscience studies related to river hydrology at both global and local scales.

            Plain Language Summary
            Rivers play important roles in global hydrological and biogeochemical cycles, and many socioeconomic activities also depend on water resources in river basins. Global-scale frontier studies of river networks and surface waters require that all rivers on the Earth are precisely mapped at high resolution, but until now, no such map has been produced. Here we present {\textquotedblleft}MERIT Hydro,{\textquotedblright} the first high-resolution, global map of river networks developed by combining the latest global map of land surface elevation with the latest maps of water bodies that were built using satellites and open databases. Surface flow direction of each 3-arc sec pixel ({\textasciitilde}90-m size at the equator) is mapped across the entire globe except Antarctica, and many supplemental maps (such as flow accumulation area, river width, and a vectorized river network) are generated. MERIT Hydro thus represents a major advance in our ability to represent the global river network and is a data set that is anticipated to enhance a wide range of geoscience applications including flood risk assessment, aquatic carbon emissions, and climate modeling.

In this paper, we assess the use of TanDEM-X data, in combination with an external digital terrain model (DTM), to map boreal canopy heights. A comparison of the TanDEM-X canopy height model (CHM) to a validated reference lidar CHM was performed based on two definitions of canopy height: canopy surface height (CSH) and dominant height (DH) at spatial resolutions ranging from 5 to 25 m, and at stand level. We found the TanDEM-X CHM to have a coarser resolution than the corresponding lidar CHM. This was apparent in the height validation of the TanDEM-X CHM, which had a RMSE of 2.7 m at the 5-m resolution, 1.9 m at the 25-m resolution, and 1.5 m at stand level. The height differences between the InSAR and lidar surfaces varied between 1.3 and 1.5 m, but InSAR heights were below the height of dominant trees by 4.6{\textendash}7.5 m. Similar discrepancies were observed for the lidar CSH relatively to DH (6.04, 8.98, and 8.05 m, respectively). The results show that the TanDEM-X interferometric heights are very close to the lidar reference height and that penetration below the DH is caused by propagation of the microwave signal between the tree apices and the main foliage surface in boreal forest. Finally, the accuracy of InSAR height estimates was not sensitive to tree density effects, but was moderately affected by local incidence angles (LIAs), gap volume, and canopy height.},

Copulas serve as dependency models between variables and are used to propagate the imprecise models. The propagation steps are detailed in the simple case of the Sum of Absolute Difference cost function for didactic purposes. The method results in an imprecise matching cost curve. To reduce computation time, a sufficient condition for conserving possibility distributions after the propagation is also presented. Finally, results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations, indicating that the method produces envelopes capable of correctly estimating the matching cost.},

The relative accuracy is sufficient to investigate glacier surface elevation changes below one meter, and can therefore be applied over relatively short periods of time, such as those required for annual and seasonal assessments of change. The annual geodetic mass balance for the Alpine case derived from our DEM compares well to the glaciological mass balance, and multitemporal DEM analysis is used to resolve the seasonal changes of five glaciers in the Khumbu Himal, revealing that glaciological processes such as accumulation, ablation, and glacier movement mainly take place during the summer season, with the winter season being largely inactive in the year sampled.},

Dense image matching is a key component in 3D reconstruction and mapping, although the 3D reconstruction process encounters difficulties for water surfaces, areas with no texture or with a repetitive pattern appearance in the images, and for very small objects. This study investigates the capabilities and limitations of space-borne very high resolution imagery, specifically Pl{\'e}iades (0.70 m) and WorldView-3 (0.31 m) imagery, with respect to the automatic point cloud reconstruction of small isolated objects. For this purpose, single buildings, vehicles, and trees were analyzed. The main focus is to quantify their detectability in the photogrammetrically-derived DSMs by estimating their heights as a function of object type and size. The estimated height was investigated with respect to the following parameters: building length and width, vehicle length and width, and tree crown diameter. Manually measured object heights from the oriented images were used as a reference. We demonstrate that the DSM-based estimated height of a single object strongly depends on its size, and we quantify this effect. Starting from very small objects, which are not elevated against their surroundings, and ending with large objects, we obtained a gradual increase of the relative heights. For small vehicles, buildings, and trees (lengths {\textless}7 pixels, crown diameters {\textless}4 pixels), the Pl{\'e}iades-derived DSM showed less than 20\% or none of the actual object{\textquoteright}s height. For large vehicles, buildings, and trees (lengths {\textgreater}14 pixels, crown diameters {\textgreater}7 pixels), the estimated heights were higher than 60\% of the real values. In the case of the WorldView-3 derived DSM, the estimated height of small vehicles, buildings, and trees (lengths {\textless}16 pixels, crown diameters {\textless}8 pixels) was less than 50\% of their actual height, whereas larger objects (lengths {\textgreater}33 pixels, crown diameters {\textgreater}16 pixels) were reconstructed at more than 90\% in height.},

The 3D Optical Metrology (3DOM) unit of the Bruno Kessler Foundation (FBK) in Trento (Italy) has collected VHR satellite imagery, as well as aerial and terrestrial data over Trento for creating a complete testfield for investigations on image radiometry, geometric accuracy, automatic digital surface model (DSM) generation, 2D/3D feature extraction, city modelling and data fusion. This paper addresses the radiometric and the geometric aspects of the VHR spaceborne imagery included in the Trento testfield and their potential for 3D information extraction. The dataset consist of two stereo-pairs acquired by WorldView-2 and by GeoEye-1 in panchromatic and multispectral mode, and a triplet from Pl{\'e}iades-1A. For reference and validation, a DSM from airborne LiDAR acquisition is used. The paper gives details on the project, dataset characteristics and achieved results.},

This 3-D camera system is able to achieve the instantaneous full-frame 3-D imaging capabilities that no other commercially available 3-D image acquisition systems or 3-D rangefinders can currently achieve. There are no mechanical moving parts in this system, therefore the mechanical design can be very simple and reliable, and there is no {\textquoteleft}{\textquoteleft}eye-safe{\textquoteright}{\textquoteright} problem. The 3-D camera can be integrated using all off-the-shelf products, which leads to a very low production cost and short development period. The 3-D camera is also able to provide normal 2-D intensity image of the scene using a single camera, which will greatly facilitate the object recognition and the sensor fusion tasks in machine vision applications.

These images are taken in such rapid succession that they form a solid block of data in which the temporal continuity from image to image is approximately equal to the spatial continuity in an individual image. The technique utilizes knowledge of the camera motion to form and analyze slices of this solid. These slices directly encode not only the three-dimensional positions of objects, but also such spatiotemporal events as the occlusion of one object by another. For straight-line camera motions, these slices have a simple linear structure that makes them easier to analyze. The analysis computes the threedimensional positions of object features, marks occlusion boundaries on the objects, and builds a threedimensional map of "free space." In our article, we first describe the application of this technique to a simple camera motion, and then show how projective duality is used to extend the analysis to a wider class of camera motions and object types that include curved and moving objects.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method creating disparity confidence intervals based on the cost volume. This method relies on possibility distributions to interpret the epistemic uncertainty of the cost volume. Our method has the benefit of having a white-box nature, differing in this respect from current state-of-the-art deep neural networks approaches. The accuracy and size of confidence intervals are validated using the Middlebury stereo datasets as well as a dataset of satellite images. This contribution is freely available on GitHub.},

(Thornton, Colorado) has adopted the RFM' as an alternative sensor model for image exploitation. The RFM has also been implemented in some digital photogrammetric systems to replace the physical sensor mode for photogrammetric processing. However, there have been few publications addressing the theoretical properties and practical aspects of the RFM until recently. In this paper a comprehensive study of the RFM is reported upon. Technical issues such as the solutions, feasibility, accuracy, numerical stability, and requirements for control information are addressed. Both the direct and iterative least-squares solutions to the RFM are derived, and the solutions under terrain-dependent and terrain-independent computation scenarios are discussed. Finally, evaluations of the numerous tests with different data sets are analyzed. The objective of this study is to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the issues pertaining to applications of the RFM.},

The sophisticated geometric and radiometric characteristics of the IKONOS sensor provide the end user with excellent metric accuracy and wealth of information which can be used for interpretive analysis. In order to be able to perform stereo feature extraction with sufficient accuracy the very complex IKONOS sensor model needs to be effectively communicated to softcopy photogrammetric software. The Rational Polynomial Camera (RPC) model accomplishes such task with great efficiency and no discernable loss of accuracy. Since the RPC IKONOS model is expressed simply as a ratio of two cubic polynomials it is generic enough to be easily interfaced with most COTS photogrammetric packages. Furthermore, it contains enough degrees of freedom to maintain full accuracy of the physical IKONOS sensor model. The paper demonstrates that the RPC IKONOS model differs by no more than 0.04 pixel from the physical model, with the RMS error below 0.01 pixel.},

	abstract = {Assessment of a DEM{\textquoteright}s quality is usually undertaken by deriving a measure of DEM accuracy {\textendash} how close the DEM{\textquoteright}s elevation values are to the true elevation. Measures such as Root Mean Squared Error and standard deviation of the error are frequently used. These measures summarise elevation errors in a DEM as a single value. A more detailed description of DEM accuracy would allow better understanding of DEM quality and the consequent uncertainty associated with using DEMs in analytical applications. The research presented addresses the limitations of using a single root mean squared error (RMSE) value to represent the uncertainty associated with a DEM by developing a new technique for creating a spatially distributed model of DEM quality {\textendash} an accuracy surface. The technique is based on the hypothesis that the distribution and scale of elevation error within a DEM are at least partly related to morphometric characteristics of the terrain. The technique involves generating a set of terrain parameters to characterise terrain morphometry and developing regression models to define the relationship between DEM error and morphometric character. The regression models form the basis for creating standard deviation surfaces to represent DEM accuracy. The hypothesis is shown to be true and reliable accuracy surfaces are successfully created. These accuracy surfaces provide more detailed information about DEM accuracy than a single global estimate of RMSE.},

	abstract = {The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) system on board the Terra (EOS AM-1) satellite has been a source of stereoscopic images covering the whole globe at 15-m resolution with consistent quality for over 16 years. The potential of these data in terms of geomorphological analysis and change detection in three dimensions is unrivaled and should be exploited more. Due to uncorrected errors in the image geometry due to sensor motion ({\textquotedblleft}jitter{\textquotedblright}), however, the quality of the DEMs and orthoimages currently available is often insufficient for a number of applications, including surface change detection. We have therefore developed a series of algorithms packaged under the name MicMac ASTER (MMASTER). It is composed of a tool to compute Rational Polynomial Coefficient (RPC) models from the ASTER metadata, a method that improves the quality of the matching by identifying and correcting jitter-induced cross-track parallax errors and a correction for along-track jitter when computing differences between DEMs (either with another MMASTER DEM or with another data source). Our method outputs more precise DEMs with less unmatched areas and reduced overall noise compared to NASA{\textquoteright}s standard AST14DMO product. The algorithms were implemented in the open source photogrammetric library and software suite MicMac. Here, we briefly examine the potential of MMASTER-produced DEMs to investigate a variety of geomorphological changes, including river erosion, seismic deformation, changes in biomass, volcanic deformation and glacier mass balance.},
